# You have a GitHub workflow that deploys an Azure web app. The workflow is configured to trigger a deployment following a pull request that includes a label.

You plan to configure the pull request of the workflow to trigger the deployment only if the label is set to a string of "stage".

The workflow includes the following section.

if: contains(<missing element>.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'stage')

What should you add for the missing element of the workflow?

Select only one answer.

action
github
name
workflow

The correct answer is:

**github**

The full condition should be:

```yaml
if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'stage')
```

This utilizes the `github` context provided by GitHub Actions, which contains information about the event that triggered the workflow, including pull request labels.

# You plan to add a job to a GitHub workflow that will deploy a container-based web app to Azure Web Apps.

You need to ensure that a previous job in the workflow completes successfully before the new job can run.

Which GitHub workflow element should you add to the workflow?

Select only one answer.

contains
needs
runs-on
uses

To ensure that a previous job completes successfully before a new job runs in a GitHub workflow, you should use the **needs** element. The `needs` element specifies the dependencies between jobs so that the new job will only run after the specified job(s) have completed successfully.[^2_1][^2_2][^2_3]

# You are reviewing GitHub actions that have been created in your organization.

You need to resolve the following issues that you identified:
The definitions of many actions are long and complex.
Ongoing management of actions is difficult because the same code is repeated in many actions.
What should you do to resolve the issues?

Select only one answer.

Remove all secrets embedded in the action files.
Create chainable actions.
Separate variable definitions into separate files.
Separate variable group definitions into separate files.

To resolve the issues of long and complex action definitions and repetitive code in many actions, you should **create chainable actions** (also known as reusable or composite actions). Creating chainable actions reduces duplication, simplifies maintenance, and centralizes commonly used logic so that you only have to update it in one place.[^3_1][^3_2][^3_3]

# You have an Azure subscription that contains a resource group named RG1.

You have a GitHub repository that contains the following resources:

Resource 1:
Name: main.bicep
Type: Bicep file

Resource 2:
Name: main.yml
Type: GitHub Actions workflow file

Resource 3:
Name: AZURE_RG1
Type: Secret

Resource 4:

Type: Secret

Resource 5:
Name: AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION
Type: Secret

You create a service principal and assign it least privilege access to deploy resources to RG1.
You need to configure main.yml to authenticate to Azure by using the AZURE_CREDENTIALS secret. The solution must follow the principle of least privilege.

What should you do?

Select only one answer.

Add a step that uses the azure/login@v1 action and specifies the client-id, tenant-id, and subscription-id inputs.

Add a step that uses the azure/login@v1 action and uses the creds input.

Create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) service connection that uses the service principal.

Create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) service connection that uses a federated identity.

Add a step to your workflow that uses the **azure/login@v1 action and uses the creds input**. This step should specify `creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}` to authenticate to Azure using the least privilege service principal stored in your secret, which aligns with best practices for security and access control.[^6_1][^6_2][^6_3][^6_4]

# You use pipelines to deploy Azure infrastructure.

You plan to implement an Azure Policy solution to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. The solution must meet the following requirements:
Audit unencrypted Azure SQL databases.
Monitor network security groups (NSGs) for specific ports.
Monitor whether vulnerability assessment solutions are installed on virtual machines.
Group all requirements for ease of administration.

What should you include in the solution?

Select only one answer.

initiative definition
policy definition
policy remediation
policy scope

You should include an **initiative definition** in your solution. An initiative definition allows you to group multiple Azure Policy definitions together—such as auditing unencrypted SQL databases, monitoring NSGs for specific ports, and checking for VM vulnerability assessment solutions—making administration and assignment of related compliance policies much easier.[^7_1][^7_2]

# You have an Azure DevOps organization named Contoso and a GitHub repository named Repo1.

Your development team uses Azure Boards to track user stories and bugs.
You need to ensure that each code change made in GitHub can be traced directly back to the corresponding Azure Boards work items.
Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

Select all answers that apply.

Configure GitHub branch protection rules to require passing a status check.

From Azure Pipelines, create a build retention policy to indefinitely store build artifacts.

Create a GitHub action that validates all commit messages.

Configure GitHub Actions to automatically assign pull requests to Azure Boards based on labels.

To ensure that each code change made in GitHub can be traced directly back to the corresponding Azure Boards work items, you should:

1. Configure GitHub branch protection rules to require passing a status check.
2. Create a GitHub action that validates all commit messages.

These steps support traceability by ensuring commits reference the work items properly (typically using "AB\#<work item ID>" syntax in commit messages) and enforce rules before merging code changes, providing a direct link between commits and Azure Boards work items.[^10_1][^10_2][^10_3][^10_4]

The other options, such as retention policies or pull request assignments, do not directly establish this traceability.

# You have a GitHub repository named Repo1 that contains the source code of a web app.

You have an Azure DevOps organization named Contoso.
You need to link Repo1 to an Azure DevOps project in Contoso. The solution must meet the following requirements:
Associate GitHub commits, pull requests, and issues with corresponding work items in Azure Boards.
Follow the principle of least privilege.

What should you use?

Select only one answer.

a GitHub app installed in the GitHub organization
a GitHub user account that is a member of Repo1
a personal access token (PAT) from your GitHub account
your GitHub account credentials

The best choice to link a GitHub repository (Repo1) to an Azure DevOps project in Contoso, while following the principle of least privilege and associating GitHub commits, pull requests, and issues with Azure Boards work items, is:

**a GitHub app installed in the GitHub organization**

Explanation:

- The GitHub App for Azure DevOps provides an integrated and secure way to connect GitHub repositories with Azure Boards.
- It delegates permissions following the principle of least privilege by granting scoped access specific to the organization or repository.
- This app enables linking commits, pull requests, and issues to work items in Azure Boards seamlessly.
- Using a GitHub user account, personal access token (PAT), or credentials would not follow least privilege as directly or securely as the GitHub App.[^11_1][^11_2][^11_3][^11_4]

# You have a GitHub repository named Repo1 and a GitHub project named Project1.

You need to add issues to Project1.
Which two actions can you perform? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

Select all answers that apply.

Create a workflow, and then link it to Project1.
Open an issue, and then assign it to Project1.
Open an issue, and then assign it to the Project1 milestone.
Open the Iteration Plan of Project1, select Add item, and then choose the issue.

The two actions you can perform to add issues to Project1 are:

- **Open an issue, and then assign it to Project1**
- **Open the Iteration Plan of Project1, select Add item, and then choose the issue**

Explanation:

- Issues can be directly linked or assigned to a GitHub project (Project1) by using the project assignment feature.
- The Iteration Plan in the project allows adding existing issues as items to organize work.
- Assigning an issue to a milestone does not directly add it to the project board; milestones and projects are separate organizational tools.
- Creating a workflow and linking it to the project is not a direct method to add issues to a project board.[^12_1][^12_2][^12_3]

# You have a GitHub repository named Repo1 that is used by two teams named Team1 and Team2. The teams work independently.

You need to recommend a planning solution for each team. The solution must meet the following requirements:

Each team must have its own Azure Boards board.

Each team board must be accessible to only the team’s respective members.

The solution must minimize administrative effort.

What should you include in the recommendation?
Select only one answer.

one Azure DevOps project that contains a board for each team
one GitHub project that contains a label for each team
one Azure DevOps project for each team
one GitHub project for each team

The best recommendation is:

**one Azure DevOps project for each team**

Explanation:

- Creating one Azure DevOps project per team allows each team to have its own dedicated Azure Boards board.
- Each project can have access permissions configured separately to restrict board access only to the respective team members, meeting the security requirement.
- This approach minimizes administrative overhead by using the native project isolation and permission management capabilities of Azure DevOps.
- A single Azure DevOps project or GitHub project would require complex permission management to isolate boards by team, increasing administrative effort.[^13_1][^13_2][^13_3]

Create a GitHub action in GitHub.
Create a GitHub repository service connection in Project1.
Install the Azure Boards app from GitHub Marketplace.

The first thing you should do is:

**Install the Azure Boards app from GitHub Marketplace**

Explanation:

- Installing the Azure Boards app in GitHub integrates GitHub repositories with Azure Boards, enabling direct referencing and linking of Azure Boards work items from GitHub pull requests.
- This app facilitates the connection between GitHub and Azure DevOps Boards without requiring custom workflows or service connections initially.
- Once installed, developers can mention work items (e.g., AB\#123) in pull requests and commits to establish traceability.[^14_1][^14_2][^14_3][^14_4]

# You have an Azure DevOps project named Project1 that contains an Azure Repos repository named Repo1.

You have a GitHub repository named Repo2.
You need to integrate Azure Boards with both Repo1 and Repo2 so that work items can be tracked across both repositories within Project1.

What should you do first?

Select only one answer.

Add Repo2 to the GitHub connections for Project1.
Add the GitHub SSH key to Project1.
Move Repo1 to GitHub as a repository.
Move Repo2 to Project1.

The correct first step is:

**Add Repo2 to the GitHub connections for Project1**

Explanation:

- To track work items from both the Azure Repos repository (Repo1) and the GitHub repository (Repo2) within the same Azure DevOps project (Project1), you integrate Repo2 by adding it to the GitHub connections for Project1.
- This enables Azure Boards to link work items with commits and pull requests across both repositories without needing to move repositories or change their hosting.
- Adding a GitHub SSH key or moving repositories is unnecessary and does not directly achieve integration for work item tracking.[^15_1][^15_2][^15_3][^15_4]

# You have an Azure DevOps project named Project1 that contains two branches named main and branch1.

You need to ensure that when branch1 merges back into main, a pull request is created.

What should you do?

Select only one answer.

Configure a branch policy for branch1.
Configure a branch policy for main.
Configure branch security for branch1.
Configure branch security for main.

The correct answer is:

**Configure a branch policy for main**

Explanation:

- To ensure that when changes from branch1 are merged back into main, a pull request is created and subject to policy checks, you configure a branch policy on the target branch—in this case, **main**.
- Branch policies on the target branch enforce PR creation, reviews, and validation before the branch can be updated.
- Configuring branch policies on the source branch (branch1) or branch security alone will not enforce pull request creation on merges into main.[^16_1][^16_2][^16_3]

# You have an Azure Repos repository named Repo1.

You plan to create a new branch named branch1.
You need to ensure that branch1 starts from a commit of 3a1b2c4d.
Which Git command should you use?
Select only one answer.

git branch branch1
git branch branch1 3a1b2c4d
git checkout -b branch1
git checkout -b branch1 3a1b2c4d

The correct command to create a new branch named branch1 starting from the commit 3a1b2c4d is:

```bash
git branch branch1 3a1b2c4d
```

Explanation:

- `git branch <branch-name> <commit-hash>` creates a new branch at the specified commit without switching to it.
- Using `git checkout -b branch1 3a1b2c4d` also creates the branch at that commit and switches to it immediately.
- Between the choices, the best fit based on the question wording ("ensure that branch1 starts from a commit") is the explicit `git branch branch1 3a1b2c4d` command, which directly creates the branch pointing to the given commit.[^17_5][^17_7][^17_8]

# You have a GitHub repository named Repo1.

Your team allows external contributors to submit changes without affecting the main repository.
You need to recommend a workflow that supports independent contributions and controlled integration by maintainers.
Which type of workflow should you recommend?
Select only one answer.

centralized
feature branch
forking
GitFlow

The recommended workflow for supporting independent contributions from external contributors without affecting the main repository, with controlled integration by maintainers, is the:

**forking** workflow

Explanation:

- The forking workflow allows external contributors to create copies (forks) of the main repository, make changes independently, and submit pull requests for maintainers to review and merge.
- This ensures maintainers have control over what gets integrated while allowing unrestricted external collaboration.
- The centralized, feature branch, and GitFlow workflows typically assume contributors have write access directly to the main repository, which is not ideal for external contributions.[^18_1][^18_2][^18_3]

# You have a GitHub repository named Repo1 that contains the following branches:

main
feature/feature1
feature/feature2
release/release1
You discover that new commits in the main branch reference either feature/feature1 or feature/feature2 as their parent commit.
You need to configure a GitHub branch protection rule for main to ensure that future commits do NOT use a merge strategy.
Which rule should you apply to the branch protection configuration?

Select only one answer.

Require a pull request before merging.
Require linear history.
Require signed commits.
Require status checks to pass before merging.

The correct branch protection rule to ensure that future commits on the main branch do **NOT** use a merge strategy is:

**Require linear history**

Explanation:

- Requiring linear history ensures that merges are done using rebase or squash merge strategies, which create a linear commit history without merge commits.
- This prevents regular merge commits that result from typical merge strategies and keeps the commit history straight and linear.
- Requiring a pull request or status checks does not enforce the type of merge strategy.
- Requiring signed commits is about verifying commit signatures, not merge style.[^19_1][^19_2]

# You have an Azure subscription that contains a Log Analytics workspace.

You plan to create a custom dashboard to display Azure DevOps pipeline metrics, such as duration and failure rate.
You need to configure a monitoring tool for the dashboard. The solution must minimize engineering effort.

What should you configure?
Select only one answer.

a GitHub Actions insight
a Microsoft Power BI semantic model
an Azure dashboard
an Azure Monitor workbook

The appropriate solution to display Azure DevOps pipeline metrics with minimal engineering effort is:

**an Azure Monitor workbook**

Explanation:

- Azure Monitor workbooks provide a flexible way to create custom dashboards that visualise metrics and logs from various Azure resources, including Azure DevOps pipelines data via Log Analytics.
- They are designed for quick configuration and rich visualization, reducing the need for extensive development effort.
- Power BI can be used for advanced analytics, but it requires additional setup and data modeling, whereas Azure Monitor workbooks offer a more straightforward, integrated approach.
- GitHub Actions insights are specific to GitHub and do not directly integrate with Azure DevOps pipeline metrics.[^20_1][^20_2][^20_3]

# You have a GitHub repository named Repo1.

You need to monitor repository activity to view data, such as the number of open issues, the pull request frequency, and contributors' activity over time. The solution must minimize configuration effort.

What should you use?
Select only one answer.

GitHub Actions
GitHub insights
GitHub webhooks
GitHub workflows

The best choice to monitor repository activity such as the number of open issues, pull request frequency, and contributors' activity over time with minimal configuration effort is:

**GitHub insights**

Explanation:

- GitHub Insights provides built-in analytics and visualizations for repository activity and metrics without requiring custom setup or additional workflows.
- It offers dashboards showing issue counts, pull request trends, and contributor statistics directly in the GitHub interface.
- GitHub Actions and workflows automate tasks but do not provide native activity monitoring dashboards.
- GitHub webhooks enable event-driven automation but require integrating with external systems for analytics.[^21_1][^21_2]

# You receive a smart detection notification from Application Insights because the performance of an app has degraded.

What are three factors that can cause smart detection notifications to be raised?
Select all answers that apply.

App dependencies are responding more slowly than usual.
The app is responding to requests more slowly than usual.
The app is using more memory than usual.
Pages are loading slower on one type of browser.

Three factors that can cause smart detection notifications to be raised in Application Insights are:

- App dependencies are responding more slowly than usual.
- The app is responding to requests more slowly than usual.
- Pages are loading slower on one type of browser.

Explanation:
Smart Detection in Application Insights uses machine learning to identify abnormal patterns and performance degradations such as slow app responses, slow external dependencies, and slower page loads on specific browsers. Increased memory usage alone is not typically a direct trigger for Smart Detection alerts.[^22_1][^22_5][^22_6]

# You receive a smart detection notification from Application Insights for an app connected to an Azure SQL database.

In the notification, you notice that exceptions are being thrown.
What can you use to investigate the exceptions?
Select only one answer.

.NET Reflector
Fiddler
Snapshot Debugger
SQL Server Profiler

The best tool to investigate exceptions after receiving a smart detection notification from Application Insights is:

**Snapshot Debugger**

Explanation:

- The Snapshot Debugger captures snapshots of your application when exceptions occur, allowing you to see the state of the app, including call stacks and variable values, exactly when the exception was thrown.
- It integrates with Application Insights, providing detailed context to diagnose runtime exceptions without requiring reproduction in a local development environment.
- .NET Reflector is used for decompiling and understanding assemblies, not runtime exception investigation.
- Fiddler is a web debugging proxy, mainly for HTTP traffic inspection.
- SQL Server Profiler is used for monitoring SQL Server events, not application exceptions directly.[^23_1][^23_2][^23_3]

# You have a globally distributed Azure web app named WebApp1 that is configured for Azure Application Insights.

You receive a Smart Detection-generated alert regarding an issue with WebApp1 that results in an exception every time users in Singapore open a specific page.
You need to verify whether the issue is limited to specific regions.
What should you do?

Select only one answer.

Configure availability tests.
Configure user flows.
Modify the Smart Detection rules.
Update the Application map components.

The correct action to verify whether the issue is limited to specific regions is to:

**Configure availability tests**

Explanation:

- Availability tests in Azure Application Insights allow you to monitor the performance and availability of your application from various global locations.
- Running these tests from different regions, including Singapore, lets you verify if the exception issue is isolated to certain geographic locations.
- User flows are used for tracking user journeys and behaviors.
- Modifying Smart Detection rules or updating Application Map components won't directly help to isolate regional issues as effectively as availability tests.[^24_1][^24_2]

# You have an Azure subscription that contains a resource group named RG1. RG1 contains an Application Insights instance named Insight1.

Four users are assigned the following Azure roles:
User1: Owner at the subscription scope
User2: Monitoring Reader at the Insight1 scope
User3: Automation Operator at the RG1 scope
User4: Security Admin at the root management group scope
Smart Detection notifications are enabled for a project.
Which user will receive Smart Detection notifications by default?

Select only one answer.

User1
User2
User3
User4

By default, Smart Detection notifications are sent to users who have the **Monitoring Reader** or **Monitoring Contributor** roles on the subscription scope.

Given the roles of the users:

- User1: Owner at the subscription scope (has Monitoring Contributor implicitly)
- User2: Monitoring Reader at the Insight1 scope
- User3: Automation Operator at the RG1 scope (not Monitoring Reader/Contributor)
- User4: Security Admin at the root management group scope (not Monitoring Reader/Contributor)

The user that will receive Smart Detection notifications by default is:

**User2**

Explanation:

- Notifications go to Monitoring Reader or Contributor roles on the scope of Application Insights.
- Owner role (User1) is broader, but default notifications specifically target Monitoring Reader/Contributor roles.
- Automation Operator and Security Admin roles do not receive these notifications by default.[^25_1][^25_2][^25_3]
