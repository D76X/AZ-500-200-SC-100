Domains

[Your Microsoft Fabric Is a Mess Without DOMAINS\!  Guy in a Cube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFBL2PcVqQU) 

[Implement Security and Governance in Microsoft Fabric by Majid Hajian \- Pluralsight \- Domains Tenant Level Settings](https://app.pluralsight.com/ilx/video-courses/clips/58f69741-bd0e-4c69-9717-2dac27a12a73) 

[Azure Fabric Domains](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/governance/domains) 

In Fabric, a domain is a way of logically **grouping together all the data** in an organization that is relevant to a **particular area or field**. 

One of **the most common uses for domains is to group data by business department**, allowing departments **to manage their data according to their specific regulations, restrictions, and requirements**.

To group data into domains, **workspaces are associated with domains**.

When a workspace is associated with a domain, all the items in the **workspace** are also associated with the domain, and they **receive a domain attribute as part of their metadata**.

There are two user cases for Domains:

1. **Filtering:** for instance, in the OneLake catalogue, users can filter content by domain in order to find content that is relevant to them.  
     
2. **Tenant-Level Settings by Domain:** some tenant-level settings for managing and governing data can be **delegated to the domain level**, thus **allowing domain-specific configuration of those settings**.

## [**Implement Security and Governance in Microsoft Fabric by Majid Hajian**](https://app.pluralsight.com/ilx/video-courses/clips/d0171571-1815-4581-9bdb-a53f0517a4c3) 

[**Zero Trust Principles** are applied](https://app.pluralsight.com/ilx/video-courses/clips/d0171571-1815-4581-9bdb-a53f0517a4c3):

1. Verify explicitly: do not rely on base assumptions; instead, verify all access requests.  
     
2. Use least privilege access: **JIT+JEA**  
     
3. Assume Breach:   
     
   1. Always assume the security controls can fail.  
   2. Continuously monitor.  
   3. Detect and respond to limit damage.

**Azure Fabric implements ZT by treating identity as the input parameter with the following controls**:

1. Microsoft Entra ID  
2. MFA  
3. Conditional Access

**Multilayer  Security Access in Microsoft Fabric**

1. **Tenant-Wide** policies for:  
     
   1. Authentication   
   2. Governamce  
   3. Compliance

2. Use **Domain** for better governance.  
     
3. **Workspace-level** security to control access to each Workspace.  
     
4. **Compute-level & Item-level** permissions can be set to restrict access and operation on, i.e. Data Warehouse, Lakehouse, Semantic Models.  
     
5. **Object-level & File-level** security permissions, i.e. table, view and reports.  
     
6. **Row-level & Column-level** security permissions.

---

In addition to **Conditional Access Policies**, which are used to control access to the SaaS frontend in real time in Azure Fabric, there are two other security concepts at work: 

1. **External Sharing Controls** in Azure Fabric  
2. **Data Residency Policies** in Azure Fabric  
3. **Network Isolation** in Azure Fabric

### External Sharing Controls

These allow you to **safely share data across different Fabric tenants** by enabling it in the admin portal of both the sharing and receiving tenants by creating shares from the OneLake data hub, and specifying who can create and accept shares. 

This feature **leverages OneLake** **for in-place, read-only data sharing** and supports items like **Lakehouses, Warehouses, and KQL databases**. 

**You control sharing by enabling the feature, selecting specific folders or tables,** and **inviting external users via their email addresses**, who then receive a link to accept the share within their own tenant.

### Data Residency Policies

It is managed by **associating a Fabric tenant with a metadata platform cluster in a chosen region**, which **dictates where your tenant metadata and customer data are stored and processed**. 

You control data location **for workspaces and can use Azure Policy to enforce data residency by restricting resource deployment to specific geographic regions**. 

Additionally, for features like Copilot in Fabric, there's a setting to allow data to be processed outside your tenant's region, but it defaults to staying within the designated geographic boundary, according to Microsoft Community information

### Network Isolation in Azure Fabric

Network isolation for Microsoft Fabric uses **Private Links** to enable secure connectivity from Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) to Fabric workspaces, **blocking public access** and ensuring only VNet-approved traffic reaches Fabric features. 

This is further enhanced by Managed Virtual Networks that isolate Spark workloads, while Managed Identities and **Private Link** support for different experiences allow granular control over network access.

# Data Lakehouse & Data Warehouse

# Data Lakehouse

[What is a data lakehouse?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/lakehouse/)   
[Microsoft Fabric Overview \- John Savill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbxVsi94DrE&t=2952s) 

* **A data warehouse** is **optimized for structured data** and **business intelligence**.   
* It focuses on well-defined, structured data for reporting and analysis.

* **Data lakehouse** combines the strengths of both data warehouses and data lakes, offering flexibility and high performance for diverse data types.   
* It can handle both structured and unstructured data, including large volumes of raw data. 

**These two options have different behaviours when data is written to them**:

In other words the two choice between these two options depends on how you plan to write the data into them. 

* You cannot use the Spark Engine to write data to a data warehouse\!  
* You cannot use the TSQL Engine to write data to a data a lakeuse\!


Here's a more detailed breakdown:

Data Warehouse:

* **Focus:** Structured data, business intelligence, and reporting.   
* **Data Storage:** Optimized for structured data formats.   
* **Performance:** Generally high performance for well-defined queries and analysis.   
* **Cost:** Can be more expensive due to the need for structured data and specific infrastructure.   
* **Example:** A company uses a data warehouse to analyse sales figures, customer demographics, and product performance. 

Data Lakehouse:

* **Focus:** Combining the best of data warehouses and data lakes.   
* **Data Storage:** Stores structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in open formats.   
* **Performance:** Offers flexibility and can handle diverse data types, but may not always match the performance of a data warehouse for specific tasks.   
* **Cost:** Offers a balance between cost and flexibility, leveraging cloud object storage.   
* **Example:** A company using a lakehouse to analyse customer behaviour, product usage data, and social media sentiment, combining structured and unstructured data. 

Key Differences:

* **Data Types:**  
  Data warehouses primarily handle structured data, while lakehouses can handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.   
* **Flexibility:**  
  Lakehouses offer more flexibility in terms of data types and use cases compared to data warehouses.   
* **Cost:**  
  Lakehouses can be more cost-effective due to their ability to store data in open formats and leverage cloud object storage.   
* **Performance:**  
  Data warehouses are generally optimized for performance with structured data, while Lakehouses may require more fine-tuning for optimal performance with diverse data.   
* **Use Cases:**  
  Data warehouses are often used for business intelligence and reporting, while Lakehouses are used for a wider range of use cases, including advanced analytics, machine learning, and AI. 

In essence, a Lakehouse is a more modern architecture that aims to bridge the gap between the structured, high-performance world of data warehouses and the flexible, scalable world of data lakes.
