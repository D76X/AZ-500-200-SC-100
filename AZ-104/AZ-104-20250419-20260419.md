# You plan to deploy the following Azure web apps:

WebApp1, that uses the .NET 9 runtime stack
WebApp2, that uses the ASP.NET V4.8 runtime stack
WebApp3, that uses the Java 21 runtime stack
WebApp4, that uses the PHP 8.4 runtime stack
You need to create the app service plans for the web apps.
What is the minimum number of app service plans that should be created?

Select only one answer.

1
2
3
4

The minimum number of app service plans that should be created is **3**.

### Explanation

Web apps using different runtime stacks sometimes require separate app service plans, depending on compatibility:

- **WebApp1 (.NET 9)** and **WebApp2 (ASP.NET V4.8)** can be hosted on Windows-based app service plans, but cannot share a plan because .NET 9 is only supported in newer stacks and may require a separate plan from legacy ASP.NET V4.8.
- **WebApp3 (Java 21)** must be hosted on a plan with Java support; this is typically separate from .NET/ASP.NET.
- **WebApp4 (PHP 8.4)** must be hosted on a plan with PHP support, and generally, it cannot share the plan with Java or .NET/ASP.NET apps if running different stacks/versioning.

Usually:

- .NET 9 → Plan 1 (Windows)
- ASP.NET V4.8 → Plan 2 (Windows, legacy stack)
- Java 21 → Plan 3 (Windows/Linux, Java capable)
- PHP 8.4 → Plan 3 (can share with Java if Linux plan; Azure supports multiple Linux runtime stacks in the same plan)

If WebApp3 and WebApp4 run on Linux, they can share the same app service plan, but the .NET and ASP.NET WebApps will require separate (Windows-based) plans.

**Correct answer: 3**.

# You have an Azure subscription that includes a virtual network named VNet1.

You plan to create an App Service web app named WebApp1 and deploy it to VNet1.
You need to prepare the environment for the planned web app. The solution must minimize costs.
Which app service plan size should you use?

Select only one answer.

Dev / Test B1
Dev / Test F1
Isolated I1V2
Production P1V2
Production P3V3

The minimum app service plan size you should use to deploy a web app (WebApp1) that integrates with an Azure virtual network (VNet1) while minimizing costs is:

**Dev / Test B1**

### Explanation:

- Virtual network integration with Azure App Service requires the app to be in at least the Basic tier or higher.
- The Dev / Test B1 size is the smallest tier that supports virtual network integration at the lowest cost.
- Lower tiers like Dev / Test F1 (free) do not support VNet integration.
- Higher tiers such as Production P1V2 or Isolated I1V2 are more costly and provide features beyond minimal VNet integration needs.

Thus, using the Basic B1 tier is the best cost-effective choice that supports VNet integration for your web app deployment.[^2_1][^2_2]

# You plan to create an Azure container instance named container1 that will use a Docker image named Image1.

You need to ensure that container1 has persistent storage.
Which Azure resources should you deploy for the persistent storage?

Select only one answer.

an Azure container registry
an Azure SQL database
an Azure Storage account and a blob container
an Azure Storage account and a file share

The Azure resource you should deploy for persistent storage with an Azure container instance named container1 that uses a Docker image is:

**an Azure Storage account and a file share**

### Explanation:

Azure Container Instances are stateless by default, so to persist data beyond the lifecycle of the container, you need to mount external storage. Azure supports direct mounting of Azure Files shares, which are file shares backed by Azure Storage accounts. This allows your container to have persistent storage that remains intact even if the container restarts or stops. Azure Container Registry is used for storing container images, not for persistent storage. Azure SQL Database is a database service, not a file storage solution, and blob storage is object storage which is not directly supported as a mounted volume for container instances.

Therefore, the correct solution is to use an Azure Storage account with an Azure Files share for persistent volume mounting in container instances.[^3_1][^3_5][^3_6][^3_10]

# You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources:

a storage account named storage123
a container instance named container1
The subscription contains a virtual network named VirtualNet4 that has the following subnets:
SubnetA- has a Microsoft.Storage service endpoint.
SubnetB- container1 is deployed to SubnetB.
SubnetC- No resources are connected to SubnetC.
You plan to deploy an Azure container instance named container5 to VirtualNet4.

To which subnets can you deploy container5?

Select only one answer.

SubnetA, SubnetB, and SubnetC
SubnetB and SubnetC only
SubnetB only
SubnetC only

You can deploy container5 only to **SubnetC**.

### Explanation:

Azure Container Instances require that the subnet they are deployed to be explicitly delegated to Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups. This delegation means the subnet can contain only container groups and no other resource types. Since:

- SubnetA has a Microsoft.Storage service endpoint (meaning other resources are connected).
- SubnetB already contains container1 (which implies delegation).
- SubnetC has no resources connected to it, so it can be dedicated for container instances.

Only SubnetC is available for deployment of new container instances without conflict because a delegated subnet cannot contain other resources aside from container groups. SubnetB already has container1 deployed, so it is also delegated, but the question implies where new deployments can happen in this setup, with no mention that multiple containers cannot share the subnet if delegated.

However, the key rule is that all container groups must be in dedicated delegated subnets, so SubnetC is free and suitable.

Therefore, the answer options imply that deployment is allowed only to SubnetC.[^4_1][^4_2][^4_3]


| Option | Explanation |
| :-- | :-- |
| SubnetA, SubnetB, and SubnetC | Incorrect: SubnetA has a storage endpoint, not purely delegated |
| SubnetB and SubnetC only | Incorrect: SubnetB already contains container1, may allow but question implies planning new deployment |
| SubnetB only | Incorrect, container5 not restricted to SubnetB alone |
| SubnetC only | Correct: Only SubnetC is free with no other connected resources, available for container group delegation |

# You have Azure subscription that includes virtual network named VNet1 in West US region.

You plan to deploy following container instances:
instance1, running Windows container image in West US region
instance2, running Linux container image in West US region
instance3, running Windows container image in East US region
Which container instances can be deployed to VNet1?

Select only one answer.

instance1 and instance2 only
instance1 and instance3 only
instance1, instance2 and instance3
instance1 only
instance2 only

The container instances that can be deployed to VNet1 in the West US region are:

**instance1 and instance2 only**

### Explanation:

- Azure Container Instances support deployment into a virtual network for both Windows and Linux containers, but the container must be deployed in the same region as the virtual network.
- VNet1 is in the West US region, so container instances running Windows or Linux images in West US can be deployed to it.
- instance3 runs a Windows container image in the East US region, which is a different region than VNet1, so it cannot be deployed into VNet1.

Hence, only instance1 (Windows, West US) and instance2 (Linux, West US) can be deployed to VNet1, both being in the same region as the VNet, while instance3 cannot because it is in a different region.[^5_1][^5_2][^5_3]


| Container Instance | Region | OS | Can deploy to VNet1? |

# You have an Azure subscription that contains the following storage accounts:

storage1, configured as StorageV2 kind
storage2, configured as BlobStorage kind
storage3, configured as FileStorage kind
Which storage account or storage accounts can you use Lifecycle management?

Select only one answer.

storage1 and storage2 only
storage1 and storage3 only
storage1 only
storage1, storage2 and storage3
storage2 and storage3 only

The storage account or storage accounts you can use Lifecycle management on are:

**storage1 and storage2 only**

### Explanation:

- Lifecycle management policies are supported on **General-purpose v2 (StorageV2)** and **Blob Storage** accounts.
- These policies apply to block blobs and append blobs, allowing automatic transitions between access tiers and automated deletion based on rules.
- **FileStorage** accounts are designed for Azure Files and do not support lifecycle management policies for blobs.
- Therefore, lifecycle management is supported on storage1 (StorageV2) and storage2 (BlobStorage), but not on storage3 (FileStorage).[^6_1][^6_2][^6_4]

# You have an Azure storage account that contains a blob container named container1.

You need to configure access to container1.
Which authorization types can you use?
Select only one answer.
Microsoft Entra ID only
Microsoft Entra ID, shared access signature or certificate only
Microsoft Entra ID, storage key or shared access signature only
Microsoft Entra ID, storage key, shared access signature or certificate
Storage key or shared access signature only

The correct authorization types you can use to configure access to the Azure blob container named container1 are:

**Microsoft Entra ID, storage key, shared access signature or certificate**

### Explanation:

- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) can be used to authorize access with Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) and OAuth 2.0 tokens.
- Storage keys (account access keys) provide full access to the storage account and can be used for authorization.
- Shared Access Signatures (SAS) provide delegated, time-limited access to blobs or containers.
- Certificates can be used in certain scenarios for secure access.
- These combined offer flexible and secure authorization options for Azure Blob Storage.

This aligns with Azure's supported authorization methods for blobs, encompassing all these methods for access control.[^7_1][^7_2][^7_3]


| Authorization Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Microsoft Entra ID | Azure AD-based RBAC and OAuth tokens |
| Storage key | Access key for full control |
| Shared Access Signature | Delegated access with permissions |
| Certificate | Used for secure authentication |

# You have an Azure Storage account named storage1.

You create the following encryption scopes for storage1:
Scope1 that has an encryption type of Microsoft-managed keys
Scope2 that has an encryption type of Customer-managed keys
Which storage services can be used with Scope2?

Select only one answer.

blob and file only
blob, file, table, and queue
blob only
file only
table and queue only

The storage services that can be used with Scope2 (encryption scope with customer-managed keys) are:

**blob only**

### Explanation:

- Encryption scopes with customer-managed keys are supported specifically for Azure Blob Storage.
- Currently, customer-managed encryption scopes cannot be used with Azure File Storage, Table Storage, or Queue Storage.
- Encryption scopes provide granular control of encryption at the blob or container level within a storage account.
- This limitation makes Blob Storage the only supported service for customer-managed key encryption scopes in Azure Storage.[^8_1][^8_2][^8_3]

VNet2, located in the West US region. 4 virtual machines are connected to VNet2.
VNet3, located in the East US region, 5 virtual machines are connected to VNet3.
VNet4, located in the East US region, 2 virtual machines are connected to VNet4.
Every virtual network is peered with all other virtual networks.
You plan to protect all of the connected virtual machines by using Azure Bastion.
What is the minimum number of Azure Bastion hosts that you must deploy?

Select only one answer.

1
2
3
4

The minimum number of Azure Bastion hosts you need to deploy to cover all the virtual machines across the peered virtual networks is:

**2**

### Explanation:

- Azure Bastion supports deploying in one or more virtual networks within a region.
- Since all virtual networks are peered, a single Bastion host deployed in one of the virtual networks can potentially provide access to VMs in all peered networks within that region.
- However, because VNet1 and VNet2 are in the West US region, and VNet3 and VNet4 are in the East US region, you need at least one Bastion host in each region for comprehensive coverage.
- Therefore, deploying **one Bastion host in West US** (covering VNet1 and VNet2) and **another in East US** (covering VNet3 and VNet4) would satisfy the requirement.

Hence, the minimum number of Bastion hosts needed is **2**, considering regional deployment and peering.[^10_1]


| Answer | Explanation |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Not enough for multi-region, peered VNet setup |
| 2 | Correct, one per region, covering all peered networks |
| 3 | Excessive; could be reduced to 2, covering all networks |

# You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual network named VNET1. VNET1 uses the following address spaces:

10.10.1.0/24
10.10.2.0/28
VNET1 contains the following subnets:
Subnet1- has an address space of 10.10.1.0/24
Subnet2- has an address space of 10.10.2.0/28
To Subnet1, you deploy a virtual machine named VM1 that runs Windows Server. VM1 has Remote Desktop enabled.
VM1 does NOT have a public IP address.
You need to be able to deploy Azure Bastion to protect VM1.
What should you do first?

Select only one answer.

Add a new subnet to VNET1.
Add a public IP address to VM1.
Add an extension to VM1.
Modify the address space of VNET1.

The correct action to take first is:

**Add a new subnet to VNET1.**

### Explanation:

- Azure Bastion requires a dedicated subnet named **AzureBastionSubnet** within the virtual network to deploy successfully.
- This subnet must have at least a /27 address range and cannot overlap with existing subnets.
- You do not need to add a public IP address to VM1 because Azure Bastion provides secure RDP/SSH connectivity without requiring public IPs on target VMs.
- Modifying the address space is unnecessary if you have room for an additional subnet.
- Adding an extension to VM1 is not relevant to enabling Azure Bastion access.

So, first add the required **AzureBastionSubnet** to VNET1 to enable deployment of Azure Bastion to protect VM1.[^11_1][^11_2]


| Option | Explanation |
| :-- | :-- |
| Add a new subnet to VNET1 | Correct: required AzureBastionSubnet |
| Add a public IP to VM1 | Not needed for Bastion RDP connectivity |
| Add extension to VM1 | Not required for Bastion |
| Modify address space | Only if no space available for AzureBastionSubnet |

# You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual machine named VM1 and a storage account named storage1.

You need to ensure that VM1 can access storage1 by using the Azure backbone.
What should you configure?

Select only one answer.

a routing table
a service endpoint
a VPN gateway
Peering

The correct configuration to ensure that VM1 can access storage1 by using the Azure backbone is:

**a service endpoint**

### Explanation:

- Azure Service Endpoints enable secure and direct connectivity to Azure services such as Azure Storage over the Azure backbone network.
- By configuring a service endpoint for Microsoft.Storage on the subnet where VM1 resides, traffic to storage1 will remain on the Azure backbone rather than going over the internet.
- A routing table is not sufficient to route traffic over the Azure backbone for storage access.
- A VPN gateway is used for on-premises or cross-region VPN connectivity, not needed here.
- Peering connects virtual networks but does not specifically secure connection to Azure Storage.

Therefore, you should configure a **service endpoint** for Microsoft.Storage on the subnet hosting VM1 to ensure backbone access to storage1.[^12_1][^12_6][^12_8]


| Option | Reason |
| :-- | :-- |
| a service endpoint | Enables backbone network connectivity to storage service |
| a routing table | Does not guarantee backbone connectivity |
| a VPN gateway | Used for VPN, not for direct Azure service access |
| Peering | Connects VNets, not specific for Azure service access |

# You have an Azure subscription that includes the following resources:

VNet1, a virtual network
Subnet1, a subnet in VNet1
WebApp1, an App Service web app
NSG1, a network security group
You create an application security group named ASG1.
Which resource can use ASG1?

Select only one answer.

NSG1
Subnet1
VNet1
WebApp1

The resource that can use the Application Security Group (ASG) is:

**NSG1** (Network Security Group)

### Explanation:

- Application Security Groups (ASGs) are used to simplify the management of network security rules by grouping virtual machines and other resources with similar functions.
- ASGs themselves are not applied directly to virtual networks, subnets, or App Service web apps.
- Instead, ASGs are referenced within Network Security Groups (NSGs) when defining inbound or outbound security rules to apply those rules to groups of resources dynamically.
- NSG rules can use ASGs as a source or destination to streamline rule management and logical grouping of VMs or resources.

Thus, the ASG is used within the **NSG1** to control traffic, enabling more manageable and scalable security policy application.[^13_1][^13_3][^13_4][^13_6]


| Resource | Can Use ASG? |
| :-- | :-- |
| NSG1 | Yes |
| Subnet1 | No |
| VNet1 | No |
| WebApp1 | No |

# You recently create an Azure virtual machine standard backup policy.

You need to configure a retention period for virtual machine instant recovery snapshots.
What is the maximum number of days that can be set for the retention period?

Select only one answer.

5
7
14
30

The maximum number of days that can be set for the retention period of virtual machine instant recovery snapshots in an Azure standard backup policy is:

**5 days**

### Explanation:

- The default snapshot retention for instant recovery snapshots in the standard backup policy is 2 days.
- You can configure this retention period between 1 and 5 days.
- This limit applies to instant recovery snapshots that allow quick restores without transferring backup data from the vault.
- Enhanced policies allow longer retention (up to 30 days), but the question specifically refers to a standard backup policy.

Therefore, for a standard backup policy, the maximum retention for instant recovery snapshots is 5 days.[^14_1][^14_4][^14_7]


| Retention Setting | Maximum Days in Standard Backup Policy |

# Your company’s Azure subscription contains an Azure virtual machine.

You need to back up the virtual machine every 12 hours.
What should you create first?

Select only one answer.

a backup policy in a backup vault
a standard backup policy in a recovery services vault
an enhanced backup policy in a recovery services vault

The correct choice is:

**an enhanced backup policy in a recovery services vault**

### Explanation:

- Azure Backup offers two main types of backup policies for virtual machines: Standard and Enhanced.
- The Standard backup policy supports daily or weekly backup schedules, which do not allow backing up every 12 hours.
- The Enhanced backup policy supports multiple daily backups, including backup frequencies as often as every 4 hours, which covers a 12-hour backup frequency requirement.
- Enhanced policies also provide advanced features like zonal resiliency and longer instant recovery snapshot retention.
- Therefore, to back up a VM every 12 hours, you must create an **enhanced backup policy** in a recovery services vault.[^15_2][^15_5][^15_11]

| Policy Type | Backup Frequency | Suitable for 12-hour backup? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Standard Backup Policy | Daily or weekly | No |
| Enhanced Backup Policy | Multiple times per day (e.g., every 4 hours) | Yes |

# You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure disk named Disk1.

You plan to use an Azure Backup to backup Disk1.
What should you deploy first?

Select only one answer.

a Backup vault
a Storage account
a Recovery Services vault
an Azure Backup Server

The correct answer is:

**a Recovery Services vault**

### Explanation:

- To back up an Azure disk or virtual machine using Azure Backup, you must first create a Recovery Services vault.
- The Recovery Services vault manages backup data, stores recovery points, and provides management and monitoring of the backup operation.
- You do not need to create a separate storage account for this because the Recovery Services vault manages storage automatically.
- A Backup vault is an older, simpler backup solution and not typically used for Azure VM or disk backups.
- Azure Backup Server is used for on-premises backup scenarios, not for Azure disk backup.

Therefore, you should deploy a **Recovery Services vault** first to enable backup of Disk1.[^16_1][^16_6][^16_7][^16_8]


| Option | Reason |
| :-- | :-- |
| Recovery Services vault | Correct: Central resource for managing Azure backups |
| Backup vault | Older, less capable, not for Azure disk/VM backup |
| Storage account | Not needed; vault manages storage |
| Azure Backup Server | For on-premises scenarios, not Azure disk backup |

# You have a Recovery Services vault named Recovery1 that includes a backup policy named Policy1.

You back up several Azure virtual machines to Recovery1 by using Policy1.
You need to view the Azure Backup reports.
What should you do first?

Select only one answer.

Configure the Diagnostics settings of Recovery1.
Create an Azure Log Analytics workspace.
Modify the Backup Configuration settings of Recovery1.

The correct action is:

**Create an Azure Log Analytics workspace.**

### Explanation:

- Azure Backup reports rely on data collected and analyzed through Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.
- To view detailed Backup reports, you first need to create an Azure Log Analytics workspace where monitoring data can be sent.
- After creating the workspace, you can link your Recovery Services vault (Recovery1) to this workspace.
- Configuring Diagnostics settings sends logs, but the primary prerequisite is having a Log Analytics workspace to collect and analyze the data.
- Modifying Backup Configuration settings is unrelated to enabling reporting.

Thus, creating an Azure Log Analytics workspace is the first step to viewing Azure Backup reports.[^17_1][^17_2][^17_3]


| Step | Purpose |
| :-- | :-- |
| Create Azure Log Analytics workspace | Collect and analyze backup telemetry data |
| Configure Diagnostics settings | Send logs to workspace |
| Modify Backup Configuration | Not related to reports setup |

# You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources:

A resource group named RG1 in the West US region
A resource group named RG2 in the Central US region
A virtual network named VNet1 that is deployed to the West US region in RG1
A virtual network named VNet2 that is deployed to the Central US region in RG1
A virtual network named VNet3 that is deployed to the West US region in RG2
You need to deploy a virtual machine named VM1 to RG1 in the West US region.
To which virtual network or virtual networks can you connect VM1?

Select only one answer.

VNet1 only
VNet1 or VNet2 only
VNet1 or VNet3 only
VNet1, VNet2 or VNet3

The correct answer is:

**VNet1 only**

### Explanation:

- When you deploy a virtual machine (VM1) to a resource group (RG1) in the West US region, the VM must be connected to a virtual network that is in the **same region** and **subscription** as the VM.
- VNet1 is in the West US region and in RG1, which matches the VM1 deployment location.
- VNet2 is in the Central US region, a different region than VM1.
- VNet3 is in the West US region but in a different resource group (RG2). Although virtual networks can be peered across resource groups and regions, a VM can only be connected directly to one virtual network at deployment.
- Therefore, VM1 can only connect to **VNet1** at deployment.

| Virtual Network | Region | Resource Group | Can Connect VM1? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| VNet1 | West US | RG1 | Yes |
| VNet2 | Central US | RG1 | No |
| VNet3 | West US | RG2 | No |

This aligns with the Azure requirement that a VM is deployed to exactly one VNet in the same region and subscription.[^18_1][^18_3][^18_5]

Final answer: **VNet1 only**

# You have an Azure subscription.

You need to deploy a virtual machine that runs Windows Server 2025 Datacenter: Azure Edition.
Which security type can you select when deploying virtual machine?

Select only one answer.

Standard only
Standard or trusted launch only
Standard, trusted launch or confidential
Trusted launch or confidential only

The correct answer is:

**Standard, trusted launch or confidential**

### Explanation:

- For Windows Server 2025 Datacenter: Azure Edition, Azure supports three main security types for virtual machines:

1. **Standard**: The default VM security configuration covering baseline protections.
2. **Trusted Launch**: Provides advanced security features like secure boot, virtual TPM, and boot integrity monitoring to protect against sophisticated threats.
3. **Confidential**: Offers hardware-based isolation and enhanced encryption, protecting data even from the hypervisor and host OS.
- You can select any of these security types depending on your security and compliance needs when deploying the VM.
- Therefore, all three options—Standard, Trusted Launch, and Confidential—are valid security types for this VM.

This is consistent with Azure's evolving VM security capabilities supporting these options for the latest Windows Server releases.[^19_2][^19_5][^19_6]


| Security Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Standard | Baseline security configuration |
| Trusted Launch | Enhanced security with secure boot and vTPM |
| Confidential | Hardware-enforced encryption and isolation of VM workloads |

# Your company has an Azure subscription.

You plan to create a virtual machine scale set named VMSS1 that has the following settings:
Resource group name: RG1
Region: West US
Orchestration mode: Uniform
Security type: Standard
OS disk type: SSD standard
Key management: Platform-managed key
You need to add custom virtual machines to VMSS1.
What setting should you modify?

Select only one answer.

Key management
Orchestration mode
OS disk type
Security type

The setting you should modify to add custom virtual machines to VMSS1 is:

**Orchestration mode**

### Explanation:

- To add custom virtual machines to a virtual machine scale set (VMSS), the VMSS must be configured to use **Flexible orchestration mode**.
- The **Uniform orchestration mode** (which is currently set) does not support adding custom VMs; it only supports identical instances based on the scale set configuration.
- Flexible orchestration mode allows the attachment of existing virtual machines (custom VMs) to the scale set.
- Other settings like key management, OS disk type, or security type don’t affect the ability to add custom VMs.

Therefore, changing the **orchestration mode** from Uniform to Flexible is required to add custom virtual machines to VMSS1.[^20_1][^20_6][^20_9]


| Setting | Effect on Adding Custom VMs |
| :-- | :-- |
| Orchestration mode | Must be Flexible to add custom VMs |
| Key management | Does not affect custom VM addition |
| OS disk type | Does not affect custom VM addition |
| Security type | Does not affect custom VM addition |

# You have an Azure subscription and an availability set named AS1 that has 5 update domains.

You deploy 27 virtual machines to AS1.
During a planned update, what is the minimum number of virtual machines that are available?

Select only one answer.

14
20
21
22
26

The answer is:

**22**

### Explanation:

- An availability set ensures that during planned maintenance, at least one virtual machine in each update domain remains available.
- AS1 has 5 update domains and 27 VMs.
- VMs are distributed evenly across update domains as much as possible.
- The minimum number of VMs available during a planned update equals the total minus the max number of VMs in one update domain (the one being updated).
- Distributing 27 VMs evenly in 5 update domains assigns 5 or 6 VMs per domain.
- 27 VMs / 5 domains = 5 VMs in 2 domains and 6 VMs in 3 domains (because 5*5=25, 27 total means two domains get extra VM).
- The maximum update domain size is 6 VMs.
- During planned update of that domain, these 6 VMs are down; others (27 - 6) = 21 VMs remain.
- However, correct calculation accounts for balancing update domains as evenly as possible: two domains with 6 VMs and three domains with 5 VMs.
Actually, 3 domains have 5 VMs and 2 domains have 6 VMs, so max is 6 VMs unavailable, minimum available = 27 - 6 = 21.
- The minimum number of VMs available is therefore **21**.

Rechecking options: Since 21 is one of the options, that should be the answer.

Final answer: **21**


| Update Domains | Average VMs per Domain | Max VMs in Domain | Min Available VMs (Total - Max) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 5 | 5 or 6 | 6 | 27 - 6 = 21 |

So the correct minimum number of VMs available during update is **21**.

# You have a Microsoft Entra tenant that contains a user named User1.

You delete User1.
You plan to restore the User1 object.
What is the maximum number of days you have to restore User1?

Select only one answer.

7 days
30 days
90 days
48 hours

The maximum number of days you have to restore a deleted user (User1) in Microsoft Entra tenant is:

**30 days**

### Explanation:

- When a user is deleted in Microsoft Entra ID, the user account enters a soft-deleted (suspended) state.
- During this 30-day retention period, the deleted user account can be restored along with all its properties.
- After 30 days, the user account is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered by anyone, including Microsoft support.
- The 30-day time window is the fixed grace period for restoring deleted user objects in Microsoft Entra ID.

This is the default behavior and retention period for deleted users in Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) tenants.[^22_1][^22_3][^22_5]

# You have a Microsoft Entra tenant that contains the following users:

User1 has a Department set to Sales and a Country set to USA
User2 has a Department set to Marketing and a Country set to USA
User3 has a Department set to Sales and a Country set to DE
User4 has a Department set to Marketing and a Country set to DE
You create a group named Group1 that has the following dynamic membership rule.
user.country -eq "USA" -and user.department -eq "Marketing" -or user.department -eq "Sales"
Which users are members of Group1?

Select only one answer.

User1 and User2 only
User1 and User3 only
User2 and User3 only
User1, User2, and User3 only
User1, User2, User3 and User4

Let's analyze the dynamic membership rule to determine which users are members of Group1:

Rule:

```
user.country -eq "USA" -and user.department -eq "Marketing" -or user.department -eq "Sales"
```

This expression logically means:

- (user.country == "USA" AND user.department == "Marketing") OR (user.department == "Sales")


### Evaluate each user:

- User1: Department = Sales, Country = USA
Matches (user.department == "Sales") → Member
- User2: Department = Marketing, Country = USA
Matches (user.country == "USA" AND user.department == "Marketing") → Member
- User3: Department = Sales, Country = DE
Matches (user.department == "Sales") → Member
- User4: Department = Marketing, Country = DE
Does not match either condition → Not a Member


### Conclusion:

Users 1, 2, and 3 are members of Group1.

**Final answer:** User1, User2, and User3 only

# You have a Microsoft Entra tenant that contains a user named User1 and a group named Group1.

You need to enable User1 the ability to add members to Group1. Your solution should minimize administrative effort.
What should you do?

Select only one answer.

Add Group1 to new administrative unit and assign built-in Microsoft Entra role to User1
Assign custom Microsoft Entra role to User1
Modify Group1 owners
Modify Group1 properties

The correct answer is:

**Modify Group1 owners**

### Explanation:

- The easiest and least administratively complex way to enable User1 to add members to Group1 is by making User1 an owner of Group1.
- Group owners have permissions to manage group membership, which includes adding or removing members.
- Assigning or modifying group owners requires minimal effort compared to creating custom roles or configuring administrative units.
- Custom Microsoft Entra roles and administrative units offer more granular and larger-scale control, but require more setup and complexity.
- Modifying group properties alone does not grant the ability to manage membership.

Therefore, to minimize administrative effort and enable User1 to add members to Group1, you should simply **modify Group1 owners** and add User1 as an owner.[^24_1][^24_2][^24_4]


| Option | Explanation |
