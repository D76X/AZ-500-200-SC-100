# You have a Microsoft Entra tenant that contains a user named Admin1.

You need to provide Admin1 with Just in time (JIT) access to the User Administrator role.
What should you use?
Select only one answer.

1) a Microsoft Entra Authentication Method policy
2) a Microsoft Entra conditional access policy
3) Microsoft Entra ID Protection
4) Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management

To provide Admin1 with Just in Time (JIT) access to the User Administrator role in a Microsoft Entra tenant, you should use Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM). PIM allows for time-limited (JIT) role assignments with enforced multi-factor authentication (MFA) during activation, approval workflows, and control over the duration of elevated access, which fits the requirement for JIT access to a privileged role.

The other options do not provide JIT access capabilities:

- Authentication Method policies are for controlling authentication methods, not role-based JIT access.
- Conditional Access policies can enforce MFA but do not provide JIT role activation.
- Entra ID Protection focuses on security monitoring and risk management but not JIT role assignment.

Thus, the correct choice is:

4) Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management

This aligns with Microsoft's recommended approach to managing privileged roles with JIT access in Entra ID.[^1_5][^1_6][^1_9][^1_11]

# Your company is evaluating role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure.

A user who is assigned the Security Reader role at the Azure subscription level can view the permissions on all resource groups.
Select Yes if the statement is true.
Otherwise, select No.
Select only one answer.

1)Yes

2)No

The statement is true: a user assigned the Security Reader role at the Azure subscription level can view permissions on all resource groups. The Security Reader role provides read-only access to security-related information, including resources and their configurations, across the scope where the role is assigned, which includes viewing permissions on all nested resource groups within that subscription.[^2_5][^2_7]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

1) Yes

# You have a Microsoft Entra tenant that contains a registered app named App1.

You plan to expose the API of App1.
You need to add a custom scope of App1.
What should you do first?
Select only one answer.

1) Add the owner of App1.
2) Set the API permissions for App1.
3) Set the ID URI for App1.
4) Upload the manifest of App1.

To add a custom scope for App1 in Microsoft Entra, the first step you must take is to set the ID URI for App1. Before custom scopes can be defined and added, the application must have a globally unique Application ID URI, which acts as the prefix for the scope values you will later create in the "Expose an API" section.[^3_4][^3_5][^3_7]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

3) Set the ID URI for App1.

# You have a Microsoft Entra tenant.

You plan to deploy a cloud app named Salesforce.
The solution must ensure that single sign-on (SSO) is used to access Salesforce.
What should you do?
Select only one answer.

1) Add an enterprise application.
2) Implement Microsoft Entra application proxy.
3) Implement Microsoft Entra Connect Sync.
4) Register an app.

To enable single sign-on (SSO) for accessing Salesforce using your Microsoft Entra tenant, the appropriate step is to add Salesforce as an enterprise application in Microsoft Entra ID. This allows Salesforce to be configured as a SaaS app with SSO capabilities, where Microsoft Entra acts as the Identity Provider (IdP) and Salesforce as the Service Provider (SP).[^7_1][^7_2]

Therefore, the correct action to ensure SSO access is:

1) Add an enterprise application.

# You have an Azure virtual machine that has a network interface named NIC1.

NIC1 connects to a subnet named Subnet1.
VM1 is accessible from the internet.
You create two network security groups (NSGs) named NSG1 and NSG2, to which you add the following inbound allow security rules:

NSG1: Ports 80 and 3389
NSG2: Ports 443 and 3389

You assign NSG1 to Subnet1 and NSG2 to NIC1.
Through which ports can you connect to VM1 over the internet?

Select only one answer.

1) 80 and 3389 only
2) 80, 443, and 3389
3) 443 and 3389 only
4) 3389 only

When inbound traffic reaches VM1, Azure processes the network security groups (NSGs) in this order: first the NSG associated with the subnet (NSG1 on Subnet1), then the NSG associated with the NIC (NSG2 on NIC1). For the traffic to be allowed on a port, both NSGs must have an inbound rule permitting that port.

- NSG1 allows ports 80 and 3389.
- NSG2 allows ports 443 and 3389.

So, port 3389 is allowed by both NSGs, meaning Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access is allowed.

For port 80: NSG1 allows it, but NSG2 does not, so port 80 is blocked.

For port 443: NSG2 allows it, but NSG1 does not, so port 443 is blocked.

Hence, you can connect to VM1 over the internet only through port 3389.

The correct answer is:

4) 3389 only.[^8_1][^8_2][^8_3]

# Your company is evaluating application security groups.

Application security groups can be used in inbound security rules and outbound security rules.
Select Yes if the statement is true.
Otherwise, select No.
Select only one answer.

1) Yes
2) No

The statement is true. Application security groups (ASGs) in Azure can be used in both inbound security rules and outbound security rules within Network Security Groups (NSGs). This allows you to simplify security management by grouping VMs or resources based on their application roles and then applying rules that reference these groups rather than individual IP addresses.[^9_1][^9_5][^9_6]

Subnet2- has an IP address range of 192.168.2.0/24 and does NOT have any VMs connected.

You need to ensure that you can deploy Azure Firewall to VNET1.

What should you do?

Select only one answer.

1) Add a new subnet to VNET1.
2) Add a service endpoint to Subnet2.
3) Modify the IP address space of VNET1.
4) Modify the subnet mask of Subnet2.

To deploy Azure Firewall to VNET1, you need to add a new subnet named AzureFirewallSubnet. Azure Firewall requires a dedicated subnet named AzureFirewallSubnet with a minimum subnet size of /26. Existing subnets like Subnet2 cannot be used for Azure Firewall, so adding a new subnet is necessary.[^13_1][^13_2][^13_3]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

1) Add a new subnet to VNET1.

# You have an Azure subscription that contains a key vault named Vault1.

You plan to store the following keys in Vault1:

Key1, which is RSA key type.

Key2, which is RSA-HSM key type.

Key3, which is EC P-256 key type.

Key4, which is EC P-521 key type.

Which key CANNOT be marked as exportable?

Select only one answer.

1) Key1
2) Key2
3) Key3
4) Key4

# You have an Azure policy that includes following resources:

A Virtual machine named VM1.

A Network interface named NIC1.

A Public IP address named IP1.

A Storage account named storage1.

You plan to deploy Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (Microsoft Defender EASM).

Which resource can be discovered by Microsoft Defender EASM?

1) Select only one answer.
2) IP1
3) NIC1
