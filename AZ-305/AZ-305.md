## Q004-Q007:

> Overview

CompanyA sells building materials online and in retail outlets around the world. CompanyA's IT infrastructure is hosted in on-premises data centers in multiple locations. The CEO and CTO realize the potential of Microsoft Azure Cloud to increase the company's competitive advantage and eliminate security concerns.

> Existing Environment

- CompanyA operates public websites serving its online shop.
- An online shop web application is connected to an SQL database server in the backend.

- The company's Microsoft SQL database server holds a 100GB product catalog and online order data. Rapid growth of the database size is not planned.

- The Active Directory (AD) authentication provider is in place. The AD domain name is companya.com.
- Marketing documents, media files, and product manuals are stored on file share servers on-premises at the head office's location.

- Marketing documents are accessed via mapped drives on Windows 10 clients.

> Problem Statement

- The SQL database server is not highly available. Every outage means a drop in sales and loss in customer confidence.

- The online shop website's performance on Black Friday is slow. The Microsoft SQL database has been identified as the bottleneck.

- Searching the site when viewing many items on the page is slow.

- There are security concerns regarding the possible loss of financial and personal data due to the potential unauthorized access by support personnel or administrators of the SQL database content.

- Content on file share servers includes not only current files, but also historical data. This historical data is rarely accessed and is needed only in the case of requests relating to legal and compliance matters. Due to legal requirements, the historical data will have to be kept for seven years. This data occupies additional storage and is costly to manage.

- Some remote locations have a slow internet connection and, therefore, access to marketing documents from remote locations is very slow.
- Privileges and rights granted to users and identities are not supervised.

> Planned Changes

- The online shop web servers will be migrated into Azure Cloud.

- The SQL database servers will be migrated into Azure Cloud with the least amount of effort.

- Data security practices will undergo modernization according to industry standard best practices.

- Marketing documents will be migrated from file share servers onto the cloud.

- A solution to reduce costs for historical data on file shares is to be implemented.

> Technical & Business Requirements

- The SQL database must be highly available. Latency must be reduced. 

- CompanyA requires a solution to obtain real-time business insights about customers' purchasing behavior by analyzing data collected from its own online shop's website, social media channels, and partner websites.

> Security & Policy Requirements

- Legal regulations require customer data stored in Microsoft SQL Database to reside in the corresponding region of customer residence.
- All the data has to be secured at rest, in transit and in use.
- Compliance policy requires the retention of online order data for a minimum of seven years.
- Privileges and rights be granted to users and identities must be supervised.

## Q001-Q003:

Your organization is moving its business operations to Azure. Your company is organized into three departments that will deploy Azure app services and databases. A fourth department is responsible for internal operations and will deploy resources as necessary to support those activities.
Your company wants to be cost-conscious in its move to the cloud, and exercise cost and budget controls at the department level. The company plans to use the Azure Resource Usage and Rate Card APIs to colle billing data for analysis.

Initially, you set up your company's Azure with one subscription.

You need to design a solution for cost reporting by department. 
The solution should follow best practices for organizing resources and should minimize the effort required to maintain the solution.

## Q003:

Solution: You create a separate resource group for each type of resource, and tag the resources with department and billing code.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. You can create a separate resource group for each type of resource, and tag the resources with department and billing code. Microsoft's best practices recommend various options for organizing resources into resource groups, such as by resource type, by project, by lifecycle, and so forth. The use of tags lets you organize the data, and retrieve data by department for cost accounting and budgeting purposes.

---

## Q002:

Solution: You create a separate resource group for each department to host that department's resources, and limit access to the resource group through Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

The solution does not meet the goal. You should not create a separate resource group for each department to host that department's resources, and limit access to the resource group through Azure RBAC. Organizing by department is an acceptable way of organizing resources, but it does nothing toward retrieving and reporting cost accounting and budget information. Azure RBAC is used to control and manage access to resources, but it does not retrieve the information you need.

---

## Q001:

Solution: 
You create a separate subscription for each department, and use resource groups to organize resources by project.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. You should not create a separate subscription for each department, and use resource groups to organize resources by project. Creating separate subscriptions for each department adds administrative overhead. Organizing by project is an acceptable way of organizing resources, but it does nothing toward retrieving and reporting cost accounting and budget information.
