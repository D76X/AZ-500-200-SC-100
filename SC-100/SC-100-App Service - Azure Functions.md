App Service has two variations:

1. The **dedicated compute pricing** tiers, which include the Basic, Standard, Premium, Premium v2, and Premium v3.  
     
2. The **App Service Environment**, which deploys directly into your virtual network with dedicated supporting infrastructure and is using the Isolated v2 pricing tiers.  
   

The virtual network integration feature is used in Azure App Service **dedicated compute pricing tiers**.

With Azure virtual networks, you can place many of your Azure resources in a non-Internet-routable network. The App Service virtual network integration feature enables your apps to access resources in or through a virtual network.
