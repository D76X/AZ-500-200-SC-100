The Microsoft Purview Unified Catalogue is a centralised, searchable repository that acts as the foundation for data governance, helping organisations discover, understand, and manage their data across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. \\

**It allows users to register, classify, annotate, and govern data** by providing a single, integrated platform for data discovery and access control. 

The Unified Catalog connects to various data sources to provide a comprehensive, bird's-eye view of an organization's entire data estate, including: 

- Microsoft services like Azure and Fabric,   
- as well as non-Microsoft platforms like Databricks and Snowflake
