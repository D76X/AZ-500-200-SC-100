## Q035:

Your company uses the following Azure subscriptions and services:

- Azure Active Directory
- Azure Firewall
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Your security team monitors data from the above services. As part of a regular security audit, you discover that the team spends an inordinate time manually searching for relevant threat vectors and events. Additionally, the team wastes valuable time responding to low-level security events. You suggest to senior management that the company should evaluate the benefits of implementing Microsoft Sentinel. However, management needs you to justify your recommendation.
Which Sentinel-supported technologies or tools should you include in your justification? To answer, select the appropriate options from the drop-down menus.

Choose the correct options
CDN 
SASTS
SND
SOAR
KQL

To automate threat responses: SOAR
To correlate and search threat data: KQL

---

### Answer:

To automate threat responses, you should include Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) in your justification. SOAR refers to a coordinated approach to security management that combines various tools and technologies to streamline incident response. With the help of automation and orchestration, SOAR can rapidly absorb new information from diverse sources, identify patterns and correlations, and take the appropriate actions. This will help to reduce the company's reliance on manual processes and it will free up human resources for more strategic tasks.
To correlate and search threat data, you should include Kusto Query Language (KQL) in your justification. KQL is a declarative language used to query data in Microsoft Sentinel. It allows you to express simple or complex queries in a concise and easy-to-read manner. KQL is based on Structured Query Language (SQL) and provides powerful search capabilities across all your data, including unstructured data. You can use it to quickly find the information you need, without having to learn complex syntax or structure, thereby reducing the time the security team spends on searching for relevant threats.
You should not include content delivery networks (CDNs) in your justification. Azure CDN offers developers a global network of servers that can be used to cache and deliver content, such as images, media files, and application files, to users. When you use the Azure CDN, your content is cached on servers that are close to your users, which improves the performance and reliability of your applications.
You should not include Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in your justification. SAST is a type of security testing that is performed on software code. SAST consists of scanning the source code or compiled version of the application to look for known vulnerabilities. The aim is to find security issues early in the development process, before the code is deployed.
You should not include Software Defined Networking (SDN) in your justification. SDN controller architectures allow you to manage networks in a more abstract way, which can make networking more flexible and simpler. SDN allows network administrators to remotely configure and manage network devices using software, rather than having to physically access each device. Azure Stack supports SDN.

## Q034:

Your company deploys compute, network, and storage resources in Azure. You manage a security team and plan to use Microsoft Sentinel as a core component of your incident management lifecycle.
You need to identify incident classifications so that closed incidents are searchable and can be used to help resolve future incidents.
Which classification should you recommend for each of the scenarios below? To answer, select the appropriate options from the drop-down menus.

Choose the correct options

Benign Positive
True Positive
False Positive

A user signs in after hours to access a sensitive document in preparation for a shareholder meeting.
Benign Positive

A penetration tester triggers a file integrity monitoring alert on a protected file server.
Benign Positive

A contractor sends proprietary product blueprints to a personal email address.
True Positive

---

### Answer:

If a user signs in after hours to access a sensitive document in preparation for a shareholder meeting, you should recommend that the incident be classified as Benign Positive. A Benign Positive event is triggered by suspicious activity. However, the event is expected and harmless. Microsoft Sentinel uses machine learning (ML) to minimize these types of events, but in some cases the final decision must be made by a security analyst.
If a penetration tester triggers a file integrity monitoring alert on a protected file server, you should recommend that the incident be classified as Benign Positive.
If a contractor sends proprietary product blueprints to a personal email address, you should recommend that the incident be classified as True Positive. This means that the event was suspicious and correctly triggered the incident response process.
None of these scenarios should be classified as False Positive. An incident should be classified as False Positive if the alert logic is incorrect or if the data supplied to Sentinel is incorrect.

## Q033:

Your company uses Azure to host sensitive workloads. Following a security breach where a known virus infected a server VM, the system administration team deploys off-the-shelf anti-malware software. The administration team ensures that signatures are updated daily, but the server suffers a zero-day virus infection.
You need to design a solution that mitigates similar future attacks.
Which recommendation should you include in your design?


- Create an anomaly detection policy.
- Create an application security group.
- Create a firewall application rule.
- Create an Microsoft Sentinel playbook.

---

### Answer:
- Create an anomaly detection policy.

You should recommend creating an anomaly detection policy. Anomaly detection is a feature offered by Microsoft Defender for Cloud. In this scenario, the anti-malware software has been implemented properly and is updated daily but is still vulnerable to zero-day attacks. A zero-day attack is one which is either not known to software or application developers or is publicly known but has not been remediated. Behavior- based detection aims to identify malicious activity based on seemingly unrelated events, as opposed to known indicators of compromise (IOCs).
You should not recommend creating an Microsoft Sentinel Playbook. A playbook is a reusable set of steps. to perform common security-related tasks, such as investigating and responding to incidents. Playbooks can be created using Logic app designer in Sentinel and can be triggered manually or automatically in response to security events. For example, you could create a playbook that automatically responds to alerts about suspicious logins by obtaining more information about the user and their activity.
You should not recommend creating a firewall application rule. Azure Firewall is a Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) with full Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) capabilities. Azure Firewall uses application rules to define internet resources that can be accessed from a subnet.
You should not recommend creating an application security group (ASG) and assign a public IP. An ASG is a logical grouping of Azure resources that allows you to manage their security policies as a single unit.

## Q032:

Your company uses Microsoft Defender for Cloud to monitor compliance status for its multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments. Following a recent breach, an auditor reports that management ports on some VMs were not secured properly. Management has acknowledged the finding but seeks to understand how this vulnerability might have been exploited.
You need to perform a task to determine the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques an attacker may have used.

What should you do?

Choose the correct answer

- Review the security initiative for VM management ports.
- Review the associated Defender for Cloud recommendation.
- Review the vulnerability in Azure Resource Graph Explorer.
- Review the Quick Fix recommendations for the finding.

---

### Answer:
- Review the associated Defender for Cloud recommendation.


You should review the associated Defender for Cloud recommendation. Security recommendations are used to map MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. MITRE ATT&CK is a framework for understanding and describing the tactics and techniques used by malicious actors in cyberattacks. It can be used to help organizations identify and defend against threats, as well as to plan their own cybersecurity strategies. Defender for Cloud can evaluate your infrastructure against the policies you have defined and provide recommendations for remediating any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that are discovered, including the tactics and techniques an attacker may use to exploit a vulnerability.
You should not review the security initiative for VM management ports. Security initiatives are used to group rules for a specific purpose or goal. Grouping rules, or policy definitions, simplifies the tasks of assigning and managing Azure Policy. A security initiative contains at least two policy definitions.
You should not review the Quick Fix recommendations for the finding. Depending on the recommendation, Defender for Cloud may offer a Quick Fix option for resolving the vulnerability identified in a recommendation. This option allows you to identify vulnerable resources and remediate risks almost instantly. The recommendations must be carefully reviewed before any fix is applied.
You should not review the vulnerability in Azure Resource Graph Explorer (ARG), ARG is a service that enables you to query your posture data in Azure at scale. With ARG, you can query Azure for all your resources and even organize them by resource type, location, subscription, or Resource Group.

## Q031:

You create a custom query in Microsoft Sentinel. As part of the query options configuration, you select the T1204 User Execution technique family, which includes the Malicious Link, Malicious File, and Malicious Image techniques.
Which statement correctly describes this activity?

Choose the correct answer

- You are using MITRE ATT&CK to perform threat hunting.
- You are using Jupyter notebooks to perform threat hunting.
- You are using the Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) to perform threat hunting.
- You are using a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) workbook to perform threat hunting.

---

### Answer:
- You are using MITRE ATT&CK to perform threat hunting.

You are using MITRE ATT&CK to perform threat hunting. MITRE ATT&CK is a framework for understanding and describing the tactics and techniques used by malicious actors in cyber attacks. It can be used to help organizations identify and defend against threats, as well as to plan their own cybersecurity strategies. You can create custom queries in Microsoft Sentinel that analyze threat data for MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
You are not using Jupyter notebooks to perform threat hunting. A Jupyter notebook is an interactive, web- based environment for code execution commonly used to develop machine learning tasks. Jupyter notebooks in Sentinel enable you to interactively analyze and visualize data in your workspace.
You are not using a JSON workbook to perform threat hunting. A Microsoft Sentinel workbook, which is stored in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, is a reusable tool that you can use to visualize and analyze data from your Azure monitoring metrics. You can create workbooks containing multiple visuals, and then save them so you can access them later.
You are not using the Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) to perform threat hunting. Sentinel uses ASIM to normalize log data ingested from various sources. This facilitates better event correlation.

## Q030:

Your company has implemented the recommended controls for common data exfiltration attacks on network boundaries and on servers that handle sensitive information. Despite these mitigations, proprietary corporate data has been extracted and shared with a competitor.
You need to design a solution that automates the detection of unauthorized activities, for example, if employees inadvertently access systems or information that they should not be able to access.

Which approach should you recommend?

- Configure Defender Endpoint detection and response (EDR) in block mode.
- Enable the User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) functionality in Microsoft Sentinel.
- Define regular expressions in Microsoft Purview.
- Apply classification labels to sensitive data.

---

### Answer:
- Enable the User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) functionality in Microsoft Sentinel.

You should recommend your company to enable User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) in Microsoft Sentinel. UEBA uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to analyze user and entity behavior across different data sets in order to identify patterns of abnormal or unexpected behavior. This allows organizations to identify and respond to potential threats or security incidents more quickly. UEBA is often used to detect malicious activity, such as a data breach. However, it can also be used to detect non- malicious activities, such as employees accessing confidential information that they are not supposed to.
You should not recommend your company to configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detection and response (EDR) in block mode. This configuration provides an extra layer of endpoint protection when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running on a system in passive mode. When EDR is in block mode, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint uses EDR logic and functionality to identify malware that the primary antivirus application may miss.
You should not recommend your company to define regular expressions in Microsoft Purview. Purview is a Microsoft service that helps organizations manage and protect their data. It provides centralized data discovery and cataloging capabilities that can help your company ensure its compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Purview also includes features for data classification and risk assessment, making it a comprehensive solution for data governance. While regular expressions, which are advanced data search filters, may help identify some sensitive information, it will not help identify system access.
You should not recommend your company to apply classification labels to sensitive data. Purview uses labels to identify and secure data. You can think of labels as tags that specify aspects such as data sensitivity and retention requirements. Like regular expressions, classification labels on their own will not meet the requirements stated in this scenario.

## Q029:


You are a security architect for an organization that has an on-premises environment. The company is planning to migrate all its resources to Azure. Before the company can migrate workloads and resources to Azure, you have been asked to create a detailed design for the future Azure strategy. You decide to use the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework as well as the Microsoft Well-Architected Framework to help you with your design.
As part of your design you need to identify the key ways in which security will integrate with the larger organization according to the Cloud Adoption Framework Secure methodology.
Which security discipline does establishing a Zero Trust access model for modern and legacy assets using identity and networking controls sit under?

- Access control
- Security operations
- Security governance
- Asset protection

---

### Answer:
- Access control

According to the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) Secure methodology, establishing a Zero Trust access model for modern and legacy assets using identity and networking controls sits under the access control security discipline.
Detecting, responding, and recovering from attacks as well as hunting for hidden threats and sharing threat intelligence sits under the security operations security discipline.
Protecting sensitive data and systems as well as continuously discovering, classifying, and securing assets sits under the asset protection discipline.
Continuously identifying, measuring, and managing security posture to reduce risk and maintaining compliance sits under the security governance security discipline.

## Q028:

You are a Cloud Architect for an organization that is planning on migrating to an Azure landing zone. Your team is currently designing the landing zone.
You need to define the tools and controls that will be deployed to ensure the organization achieves a security baseline as quickly as possible.

Which three Microsoft Tools should you recommend to meet the goal? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

- Azure Firewall
- Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
- Route tables
- Exchange Online
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud

---

### Answer:
- Azure Firewall
- Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Security is an essential Azure landing zone accelerator and there are multiple tools and controls you can configure to assist in the journey of achieving a security baseline, in some cases much quicker than normal.
You can use Microsoft Defender for Cloud, both the standard and free tiers to help achieve security baselines. Microsoft Defender for Cloud combines development security operations (DevSecOps), cloud security posture management (CSPM), and cloud workload protection platform (CWPP) to help to protect your applications and resources against cyberthreats and vulnerabilities.
You can also use Azure Firewall to help to achieve security baselines. Azure Firewall is a cloud-native, stateful firewall as-a-service, that provides protection to your Azure workloads against network-related attacks and vulnerabilities.
You can also use privileged identity management (PIM) to help to achieve security baselines. PIM is a service that is part of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and it allows you to manage, control, and monitor access to resources within your Azure landing zone.
You should not recommend Microsoft Exchange Online. Microsoft Exchange Online is a SaaS application that is available as part of Microsoft 365 and is not intended to help to achieve security baselines. It is used to send email messages both internally and externally to allow your users to collaborate with teams, partners, and clients.
You should not recommend route tables. Route tables are a feature of virtual networks (VNets) that allow you to route network traffic both within your Azure landing zone and externally.

## Q027:


You are a Security Architect for an organization with an on-premises infrastructure. The company plans to migrate services to an Azure landing zone over the next six to 12 months and needs to design the governance and security of the Azure landing zone. You are in charge of this project.
You are currently considering the security operations and need to define the scope to ensure that virtual machines adhere to National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) Cloud Security Principle 5: Operational Security.

Which security operation scope do these requirements most likely align to?

- Security alerts
- Security controls
- Vulnerability management
- Encryption and keys

---

### Answer:
- Vulnerability management

The security operation scope of vulnerability management covers the context of:

- Emergency patching for critical vulnerabilities
- Patch for VMs that are offline for extended periods of time
- Vulnerability assessment for VMs

These three all adhere to the NCSC Cloud Security Principle 5: Operational Security, which considers vulnerability management, protective monitoring, incident management, and configuration and change management. The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework includes multiple security disciplines and guidance principles, including access control, Security assurances and security governance which all align with NCSC Cloud Security Principles.
There are multiple security operations as of the Cloud Adoption Framework when designing Azure landing zones. They cover multiple areas of security which align with the NCSC Cloud Security principles, including Security alerts, Security logs, Security Controls, Shared Responsibility and Encryption and keys.
The security alerts scope covers the following context:

- Which teams require notifications for security alerts?
- Do services need to be put into groups so alerts can be routed to different teams?
- Business requirements for real-time monitoring and alerting.
- Security information and event management integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel.

The encryption and keys scope tries to answer the questions of who requires access to keys in the environment and who will be responsible for managing those keys.
The security controls scope defines the baseline security configuration via Azure in-guest VM policy and considers how your security controls will align with governance guardrails.

## Q026:

You are an IT administrator working for an organization that has recently deployed an Azure subscription. The Dev team has started to deploy applications and services but would like to adopt DevOps models to increase the pace of innovation.
The SecOps team has asked you to review the existing deployments in Azure by the Dev team to ensure they meet security disciplines according to the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework.

Which Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework security discipline must the Dev team adhere to before they can adopt DevOps models?

- Security Operations
- Access Control
- Innovation Security
- Security Governance

---

### Answer:
- Innovation Security

The Dev team must adhere to the Innovation Security security discipline. With this discipline, security needs to become an integral part of the DevSecOps process. It will require the organization to integrate security expertise and resources directly into the DevOps cycle and it will involve shifting decision making from central teams to enable workload-focused teams.
The Security Governance security discipline is not vital for the Dev team to adhere to before trying to adopt DevOps models. This discipline relates to making delegated decisions that allow organizations to accelerate innovation and introduce new risks.
The Security Operations security discipline is not vital for the Dev team to adhere to before trying to adopt DevOps models. This discipline requires organizations to monitor IT operation to detect, respond, and recover from any type of breach. They need to utilize data to continuously reduce the risk of a breach.
The Access Control security discipline is not vital for the Dev team to adhere to before trying to adopt DevOps models. This discipline requires that organizations apply network and identity control to create boundaries and segmentation to reduce the number of security breaches.

## Q025:

You are a Security Operations Lead for a company that develops and deploys Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS). A recent security audit has recommended that the Dev team start to utilize the DevSecOps lifecycle stages to implement better security controls within their development.
You need to categorize the existing AKS deployment lifecycle tasks into the DevSecOps lifecycle stages.
Which current Dev team AKS deployment lifecycle task matches which DevSecOps lifecycle stage? To answer, select the appropriate options from the drop-down menus.

Choose the correct options

AKS deployment task |  DevSecOps lifecycle stage

Apply Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF). : Plan Phase
Secure container images. : Develop Phase
Build new images on base image updates. : Build Phase
Keep deployment credentials secure. : Deploy Phase
Update Kubernetes clusters. : Operate Phase

---

### Answer:

The DevSecOps lifecycle has multiple stages which allow you to implement security controls in each phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This is a key piece of the DevSecOps strategy.
Applying Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF) falls within the Plan Phase. The plan phase has the least amount of automation and has important security implications that will impact a lot of the late stages. Applying the Azure Well Architected Framework (WAF) applies DevSecOps and monitoring to your environment which is why it comes under the plan phase.
Securing container images falls within the Develop Phase. The develop phase entails the 'Shift-left' approach which is a key aspect of the DevSecOps process. This phase comes before any code creation or deployment is even started, and requires you to adopt secure code and best practices using Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tools and plugins. Securing container images task falls within the develop phase as you are required to use trusted, lightweight base images when building containers.
Building new images on base image updates falls within the Build Phase. The build phase allows developers to work with security teams to integrate automated scans of their app source within their Continuous Integration (CI) build pipelines. Building new images on base image updates task belongs to the build phase as Azure Container Registry tasks dynamically discover base image dependencies when building a container image.
Keeping deployment credentials secure falls within the Deploy Phase. During the deploy phase, the developers and app operators work as a single team to establish the correct security controls for the Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines. One example of this task is that the Development team can utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to allow GitHub action workflows to access resources in Azure without the need to store the credentials as a long-lived GitHub secret.
Updating Kubernetes clusters falls within the Operate Phase. The operate phase entails operation monitoring and security monitoring tasks that are proactively performed to monitor, analyze, and alert on any security incidents. Updating Kubernetes clusters fits in this phase because keeping services updated is essential so they do not fall behind or fall out of support.

## Q024:

You are an IT Administrator for a company that uses Azure services. The organization has recently had a security audit that has recommended the company start to utilize DevSecOps process when developing and deploying Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS).
The following table details the users within the Dev team and their existing responsibility:

| Username  | Role description | 
|---|---|
| DevA | Responsible for writing the application code  |
| DevB | Responsible for building containers           |
| DevC | Responsible for creating and selecting Azure Policies |

As part of the DevSecOps process you need to first ensure members of the team have a defined role depending on the tasks they cover.
Which user's job description matches the DevSecOps team responsibilities? To answer, select the appropriate answer from the drop-down menus.

Choose the correct options

DevA : Developer
DevB : Application operator
DevC : Security team

---

### Answer:

DevA should have the developer role, as they are responsible for writing the application code. They also have the responsibility for committing code to the designated repository.
DevB should have the application operator role. They are responsible for building application on the cloud by utilizing containers and Kubernetes to simplify application development, deployment, and scalability.
DevC should have the security team role. The security team is responsible for developing security standards and enforcing them by creating and selecting Azure Policies that is enforced at the subscription and resource group levels.
None of the team members have responsibilities that would come under a cluster operator role. This role is responsible for configuring and managing the cluster infrastructure and often use infrastructure as code (laC) best practices and frameworks.

## Q023:

Your company plans to migrate to Microsoft 365.
You need to translate business governance goals into security requirements.
Which Microsoft assurance area should you recommend for each security requirement? To answer, drag the appropriate assurance area to each security requirement. An assurance area may be used once, more than once, or not at all.

Drag and drop the answers

Information Assurance
Operational Assurance
Control Assurance
Outcomes Assurance

To ensure that users can authenticate with minimal latency during a server failure:
Operational Assurance

To ensure that sensitive emails are protected from eavesdropping:
Information Assurance

To ensure that retention policies are compliant with all regulatory requirements:
Information Assurance

---

### Answer:

You should recommend operational assurance to ensure that users can authenticate with minimal latency during a server failure. Operational assurance focuses on ensuring that services are available and perform as expected. It often involves service or server redundancy and it is designed to ensure data resiliency. Assurance areas in Microsoft 365 are considered part of cloud governance.
You should recommend information assurance to ensure that sensitive emails are protected from eavesdropping. Information assurance protects data confidentiality and integrity. This may be required as a business imperative, to protect proprietary information, for example, or stipulated by regulatory standards and requirements.
You should recommend information assurance to ensure that retention policies are compliant with all regulatory requirements. This aspect of information assurance focuses on data availability. This ensures that data can be restored in the event of a loss or can be used in legal or other proceedings to maintain regulatory compliance.
You should not recommend outcomes assurance for any of the listed requirements. Outcomes assurance is supported by user training so that your employees understand organizational goals and can work towards those goals while protecting system and information security and compliance. Microsoft Purview can be used to manage data retention.
You should not recommend control assurance for any of the listed requirements. Control assurance is used to ensure that security controls are operating as expected.

## Q022:

Your company hosts VM-based file, web, and database servers in the Azure cloud. You are concerned that employees accessing a general file server also have access to other servers that host sensitive information. Rather than deploy new permissions schemes on the servers, you want to mitigate this risk by ensuring the network design aligns with Zero Trust recommendations, as shown in the exhibit.

Your design must meet the following requirements:

- Limit user access to corporate file servers.
- Isolate other server workloads.
- Implement software-defined parameters.
- Reduce administrative overhead.

Which solution should you recommend?

Choose the correct answer

- The company should place each VM in an isolated VNet.
- The company should deploy VMs behind a jump box.
- The company should require a VPN for server access.
- The company should implement micro-segmentation.

---

### Answer:
- The company should implement micro-segmentation.

You should recommend implementing micro-segmentation. Micro-segmentation is a technique used for dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments. By doing this, you can further reduce the risk of data breaches and malware infections. With micro-segmentation, each segment is its own mini network with its own security controls. This isolates workloads, makes it much more difficult for attackers to move laterally within a network, and limits the impact of any breach.
You should not recommend placing each VM in an isolated virtual network (VNet). An Azure VNet is a private network in the cloud that you can use to deploy and manage your resources. A VNet provides you with an isolated and secure environment to run your applications and services. However, placing each VM in an isolated VNet is not part of Zero Trust and does not reduce administrative overhead. Common server VMs and their associated workloads can be located in the same VNet.
You should not recommend deploying VMs behind a jump box. A jump box is typically a hardened workstation that provides access to a secure network. In order to manage devices on the secure network, an administrator first connects to the jump box and then performs administrative tasks from that node. Jump boxes are also known as jump servers or bastion hosts.
You should not recommend requiring a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for server access. VPNs can be used to secure network communications, but this will not isolate the VMs from one another.

## Q021:

Your company provides custom API development services. The network and system administration team regularly builds and tears down testing and production environments to support these projects. Recently, a configuration error resulted in a breach that quickly spread to multiple environments.
You have been asked to design an Azure landing zone architecture that will reduce this risk in the future. You need to recommend a process or method for storing network and system configurations centrally in standardized files. Your approach should be based on DevSecOps best practices.
Which option should you include in your recommendation?

Choose the correct answer

- Infrastructure as code
- Continuous delivery
- Continuous integration
- Infrastructure automation

---

### Answer:
- Infrastructure as code

You should recommend implementing infrastructure as code (laC). laC is an infrastructure management methodology that stores network and system configurations centrally in standardized files. The primary benefit of using laC is the facilitation of network orchestration creating, testing, and reviewing code prior to deployment. The code is also deployed in a predictable, repeatable, and often automated way. Implementing laC also reduces the occurrence of configuration mistakes.
You should not recommend implementing infrastructure automation. Infrastructure automation aims to reduce errors by using scripts to automate repetitive tasks. Infrastructure automation does not store network and system configurations centrally in standardized files. Azure Automation can be used to facilitate infrastructure automation.
You should not recommend implementing continuous integration (CI). This is part of Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), which is designed to ensure that functional code can be deployed at any time during the development process. Cl means that code updates are made frequently. Cl does not store network and system configurations centrally in standardized files.
You should not recommend implementing continuous delivery (CD). This is the second piece of CI/CD. CD means that up-to-date code can be deployed at any time. CD does not store network and system configurations centrally in standardized files.

## Q020:

Your international company plans to gradually migrate subsidiary company platforms and applications to Azure. To ensure operational efficiency, reduce administrative overhead, and mitigate the risk of misconfigured services or systems, you have been tasked with implementing Azure landing zone architectures.
You must ensure that your design follows globally-accepted benchmarks, such as ISO 27001. Additionally, deployments must be applicable at scale and across multiple subscriptions.
Which option should you use to meet this goal?

Choose the correct answer

- Azure Blueprints
- Access packages
- Azure Policy
- Artifacts

---

### Answer:
- Azure Blueprints

You should use Azure Blueprints. Azure Blueprints is a service that helps you manage and deploy cloud resources at scale in a consistent and repeatable way. It provides a collection of templates and best practices that you can use to build your own cloud deployments and is a perfect companion to Azure landing zones. Azure Blueprints also support security and compliance governance activities, including ISO 27001. You can use this blueprint to deploy artifacts such as role assignments, resource groups, and policy assignments in an automated, orchestrated fashion.
You cannot use Azure Policy alone to meet this goal. Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you can use to create, assign, and manage policy definitions. Policy definitions specify what resources will be validated against the desired conditions. Azure Blueprints can include Azure policies, but this is not required.
You cannot use artifacts alone to meet this goal. Artifacts are components of blueprint definitions. Artifacts might include resource groups, role assignments, policy assignments, and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. Many artifacts can stand on their own, but only when contained in a blueprint definition can they be used to meet the goal stated in this scenario.
You should not use access packages. Access packages are used in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) identity governance to provide a user with the resource access they need to complete a project.

## Q019:

You are Cloud Security Engineer for an organization that has an existing Microsoft 365 and Azure tenant where you host your data estate. In a recent security incident, a member user inadvertently leaked sensitive information. This led the organization to conduct a full security review and policy assessment on all the Microsoft 365 and Azure estate.
The report highlighted that there were no existing data loss prevention (DLP) policies. Sensitive information was not clearly defined within the tenant, and no 'High Severity' DLP alerts were configured.
You need to create a policy that solves the issues listed in the report.

Which policy template should you use?

Choose the correct answer

- Risky user template
- Security policy violations
- Data theft by departing users
- Data Leaks template

---

### Answer:
- Data Leaks template

You should use the Data leaks template. This policy template requires you to configure a minimum of one Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies as well as define what is classified as sensitive information within your estate. You also configure it to receive insider risk alerts for 'High Severity' DLP policy alerts.
You should not use the Data theft by departing users template. This policy template requires you to configure the Microsoft 365 HR connector, which then imports resignation and termination date data for users within your estate.
You should not use the Security policy violation template. This policy template requires you to enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for insider risk management integration from within the Microsoft Defender Security Center. This then imports security violation alerts into the service.
You should not use the Risky users template. This policy template requires you to configure a Microsoft 365 HR connector, which then imports performance or demotion data for users within the company.

## Q018:

You are a Cloud Architect for an organization that hosts laaS, PaaS, and SaaS servicing within Azure and Microsoft Cloud. A recent security audit has made recommendations for the organization to start using the Zero Trust Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP) as an alternative to deployment guides to enable key layers of protection within the existing cloud estate.

You have the following services within the estate for which you need to adopt Zero Trust:

| Service type | Microsoft service name |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Identity     | Azure AD |
| Endpoints    | Intune     |
| DevOps       | Azure DevOps |
| IoT devices  | Azure IoT |
| Applications | Intune |

You need to ensure you prioritize the initiatives when following Zero Trust RaMP.
Which three service types should you look to modernize as a priority? 
Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

Choose the correct answers

- Identity
- Endpoints
- Applications
- DevOps

---

### Answer:
- Identity
- Endpoints
- Applications

You should modernize the Identity, Endpoint, and Application services first. The Zero Trust Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP) is an alternative to deployment guides that documents detailed configuration steps for all of the technology pillars that need to be protected by Zero Trust principles in Azure. There multiple initiatives that are categorized as 'Top Priority' and 'As needed'. The following initiatives are classed as 'Top Priority':
User access and productivity (this covers Identity, Endpoints, and Applications)
Data, compliance, and governance
Modernize security operations
You should not prioritize DevOps and lot devices as these are deemed to be 'As needed' within the RaMP and are covered by the following initiatives:
OT and Industrial IoT
Datacenter & DevOps Security

## Q017:

Your company purchases Surface laptops for all of its employees. The company requires that user systems be secured from emerging threats so you have recommended deploying Application Guard.
You need to enhance the security stance of each device.
Which two statements should you include in your recommendation? Each correct answer presents a complete the solution.
Choose the correct answers

- Application Guard relies on a locally installed Hyper-V instance to support security.
- Application Guard forces untrusted resources to be opened in a secure container.
- Application Guard is supported on end-user systems, including VDI deployments.
- Application Guard can be used to define domains that host trusted applications.
- Application Guard is only supported on systems running Windows 11 or later.

---

### Answer:
- Application Guard forces untrusted resources to be opened in a secure container.
- Application Guard can be used to define domains that host trusted applications.

Application Guard can be used to define domains that host trusted applications and forces untrusted resources to be opened in a secure container. Application Guard allows you to define domains and network ranges that host trusted applications, files, and web sites. Untrusted resources are opened in a Hyper-V container, or sandbox. This ensures that even if the resource contains or accesses malicious content, the local system will remain safe.
Application Guard is supported on end-user systems as long as those systems do not form part of a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) deployment. Application Guard is not supported for installation on VDI virtual machines (VMs).
Application Guard is supported on systems running Windows 10 or Windows 11. Application Guard can be installed on enterprise desktops, laptops, and Windows-based mobile devices.
Application Guard does not rely on a locally installed Hyper-V instance to support security. The Hyper-V container is maintained separately from the user's operating system.

## Q016:

You are an engineer for a small company that hosts it resources in a single Azure subscription. The company tenant has recently been subject to a systemic identity compromise attack where an attacker gained a foothold in Azure AD.

Your manager has asked you to map out the plan to respond to this attack and re-establish control of the Azure AD tenant without any additional third-party support.
Which four actions should you perform in sequence to meet the goal? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of possible actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.
Create a list in the correct order

Possible actions
Log a support ticket with Microsoft.
Scan for malicious files.
Isolate the bad actor.

Actions in order
Establish secure communications.
Investigate your environment.
Improve security posture.
Regain / retain control.


---

### Answer:

You should perform the following steps in order to respond to the systemic identity compromise attack and re-establish control of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant:
1. Establish secure communications
2. Investigate your environment
3. Improve security posture
4. Regain / retain control
The first step is to establish secure communications. Before taking any recovery action you should make sure that all members of the support team who are taking part in the investigation can securely communicate. Securing communications has to be your first step to allow you to proceed without the attacker's knowledge.
Next, you should investigate your environment. Once secure communications have been arranged for the main team members you should start looking into the attack, such as initial access points and persistence techniques.
Then, you should improve security posture for the tenant. You should enable security features and ensure you follow best practice guidelines and recommendations so you can improve security. You should also continue to monitor the environment as the security landscape changes.
Finally, you should regain / retain control of the environment. It is vital that you regain administrative control of Azure AD and the environment in general. Once you have control you need to ensure you refresh the estate's security posture and block all possible persistence techniques and new initial access exploits.
You should not log a support ticket with Microsoft. You would normally log a support ticket with Microsoft
for technical issues if parts of the estate are not working. However, it is not an essential part of the response plan and the scenario clearly states not to seek any third-party support.
You should not isolate the bad actor. Although as part of the investigation you may try to isolate the attacker, it is not a general step for the response to the attack.
You should not scan for malicious files. In the same way, scanning for malicious files may be a task that is completed as part of the remediation and improving security posture but it is not a general step within the response plan.

## Q013-Q015:

Your company uses Azure Synapse Analytics for data warehousing and data virtualization. Data analysts use the following Synapse resources:

- Dedicated SQL pools for big data analytics
- Serverless SQL endpoints for batch processing

You need to ensure that the Analytics deployment meets Azure Security Benchmark baseline requirements. Specifically, each Synapse resource should be accessible via a managed private endpoint.

---

## Q015:

Solution: You recommend deploying all SQL nodes in a common virtual network and that a P2S connection should be created between each endpoint and Azure Synapse Analytics.

Does this solution meet the goal?


---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal. Reaching Synapse resources via a managed private endpoint requires a Managed Virtual Network Workspace. This is a Synapse add-on feature that facilitates the creation of managed endpoints powerful compute nodes that are tailored to machine learning tasks. Point-to-Site (P2S) Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway connections are designed to connect a single endpoint to an Azure virtual network.

## Q014:

Solution: You recommend creating separate VNets for dedicated SQL pools and serverless SQL endpoints. VNets should be connected using Azure Express Route.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal. Reaching Synapse resources via a managed private endpoint requires a Managed Virtual Network Workspace. This is a Synapse add-on feature that facilitates the creation of managed endpoints powerful compute nodes that are tailored to machine learning tasks. In Azure, VNets are the basic building blocks for network segmentation and Azure Express Route lets you extend your on- premises and other-cloud networks into the Microsoft cloud over a secure, private connection.

## Q013:


Solution: 
You recommend creating a Managed Virtual Network Workspace and that all dedicated and serverless pools should be located in the workspace.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer: Yes

This solution meets the goal. Azure Synapse Analytics is an integrated Platform as a Service (PaaS) data platform that enables you to collect, clean, govern, analyze, and act on data in real time. It provides a single platform for data warehousing, big data analytics, and advanced analytics. Security for data stored in and processed by Synapse can be enhanced by implementing private endpoints. This approach is supported by the Azure Security Benchmark.
An Azure private endpoint is a network interface that connects your users privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. By deploying a Virtual Network Workspace for dedicated SQL pools and serverless SQL endpoints, you can ensure secure network segmentation. Data traversing a private link never traverses the public internet.

## Q009-Q012:

> Overview

CompanyA is an online e-tailer that specializes in high-end fashion and accessories. In the past, CompanyA worked with clothing manufactures to drop ship purchases to customers, allowing it to focus on maintaining a lightweight online presence. However, it has recently acquired several boutique clothing manufacturers and wants to bring these acquisitions into the CompanyA environment as quickly as possible. This will require CompanyA to expand operations from strictly online sales and marketing to manufacturing and delivery. Additionally, the company has experienced dramatic expansion into European and Asian markets and wants to consolidate diverse on- premises and cloud resources in Azure.

> Existing Environment

CompanyA hosts all e-commerce servers in an on-premises data center located in North America. Its customers reside across the world and many of them use the CompanyA mobile app to browse and purchase items. This app sends requests to an API endpoint using HTTP or HTTPS. When a customer completes a purchase, a third-party transaction server connects to a remote credit card processor over TCP 6868. Backend data is stored on a custom Microsoft database and CompanyA has hired a remote DBA contractor to manage the database platform using RDP.
The current e-commerce site was recently hacked and an attacker was able to modify the descriptions for many products. A third-party security consulting firm was hired to perform an investigation and confirmed that the attacker modified the underlying database information.
Systems for the recently acquired clothing manufacturers are also hosted on-premises. These databases store clothing patterns and designs in document databases.

> Requirements

The existing e-commerce platform must be migrated to Azure. Once complete, access to the migrated workload must be protected by strict inbound and outbound traffic rules. It is anticipated that this functionality will be provided by Azure Firewall.
CompanyA is committed to a green, climate-friendly operation and has publicly announced that it will be carbon-neutral within three years. To comply with this goal, it plans to deploy loT sensors in the recently acquired clothing manufacturing plants. The sensors will monitor environmental conditions, including power consumption. Additionally, the sensors will monitor resource consumption, which will aid in procuring raw materials for the manufacturing process. As the sensors will have access to CompanyA's intellectual property, they must be secured from tampering. It is anticipated that these sensors will be managed by Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS).
Given the recent database attack, CompanyA's management wants to ensure that the migrated system is secure and not susceptible to similar attacks in the future.
Clothing designs and patterns must be migrated to CosmosDB. To maximize security, this database must be segmented from other network traffic. The design for this database must meet the following requirements:

- On-premises analysts must have access to data stored in Cosmos DB.
- All network traffic must be segmented from the internet.
- Resource access must be mappable to a single database instance.


---

## Q012:

You need to design a solution for access to CosmosDB.
The solution should meet the following requirements:

- To extend your on-premises network into Azure, bypassing the internet
- To provide access to a single database instance

Which two technologies or components should you recommend for each stated requirement? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

- Virtual network TAP
- Service endpoint
- Private Link
- Express Route

---

### Answer:
- Private Link
- Express Route

To bypass the internet and extend your on-premises network into Azure, you should recommend the deployment of Express Route. Azure ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises and other-cloud networks into the Microsoft cloud over a secure, private connection. You can create hybrid applications and architectures that include both cloud and on-premises services, and you can use Express Route to bypass the public internet and improve network performance.
To provide access to a single database instance, you should recommend the deployment of Private Link. Azure Private Link is a service that enables customers to securely access Azure platform as a service (PaaS) resources over a private endpoint hosted in their virtual network. Traffic between the customer's network and Azure services traverses over the Microsoft backbone, eliminating exposure from the internet. Customers can also leverage Private Link to break out egress traffic from an on-premises network using Express Route.
You should not recommend using a service endpoint. Service endpoints facilitate secure access to Azure resources from your virtual network. However, service endpoints are not used to provide access for on- premises users.
You should not recommend using a virtual network Terminal Access Point (TAP). An Azure VNet TAP allows you to passively monitor traffic sent between nodes by mirroring network traffic to a monitoring device for further analysis.

## Q011:

You must secure the e-commerce database.
What should you include in your recommendation?

- The web development team should run all submitted user requests through a link checker.
- The web development team should add input validation functions to the shopping cart page.
- The system security team should require TLS on all servers that host web content.
- The DBA should enable data execution prevention on all servers hosting website data.

---

### Answer:
- The web development team should add input validation functions to the shopping cart page.

The web development team should add input validation functions to the shopping cart page. In this scenario, the e-commerce platform has suffered a Structured Query Language (SQL) injection attack that has allowed a malicious user to modify database content. SQL injection occurs when malicious SQL statements are inserted into an application or website field. A SQL injection attack is designed to exploit application vulnerabilities and extract, modify, or delete database information. Input validation prevents such statements from executing against a database. Tools like Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) can perform input validation.
The web development team should not run all submitted user requests through a link checker. Link checking is used to mitigate phishing and other similar attacks by verifying that links in emails and documents are authentic and not malicious. Tools like Microsoft Defender verify links using a technique known as Uniform Resource Locator (URL) scanning.
The system security team should not require Transport Layer Security (TLS) on all servers that host web content. Transport encryption methods, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), are used to ensure that data is encrypted as it travels between endpoints. Although this is best practice and is normally followed, it is not the ideal approach to mitigate the risk in this scenario.
The database administrator (DBA) should not enable data execution prevention on all servers hosting website data. Data execution prevention (DEP) marks certain areas in memory as non-executable, which prevents malicious code from running. DEP protects against buffer overflow attacks; it does not mitigate injection attacks.

## Q010:

You need to design a solution that ensures that the e-commerce application is secure.
Which Azure Firewall rule type should you recommend to meet each requirement? To answer, select the appropriate options from the drop-down menus.

To facilitate customer access to the API endpoint:
DNAT rule and network rule

To facilitate contractor access to the database server:
DNAT rule and network rule

To facilitate transaction server access to the credit card processor:
Network rule

---

### Answer:

To facilitate customer access to the Application Programming Interface (API) endpoint, you should recommend creating a destination network address translation (DNAT) rule and a network rule. DNAT rules facilitate translation from a public firewall address and port to a private IP and port. This approach is commonly used to provide access to resources configured with private IPs. A network rule is a traditional layer 3/layer 4 rule based on protocols (TCP or UDP), ports, and IP addresses. While the DNAT rule facilitates network translation, the network rule allows the specified access to the API endpoint over ports 80 and 443.
To facilitate contractor access to the database server, you should recommend creating a DNAT rule and a
network rule. As with the API endpoint, inbound access to the database server's IP will require DNAT, and the network rule will be configured to allow TCP access over the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port, 3389.
To facilitate transaction server access to the credit card processor, you should recommend creating a network rule. The network rule will allow outbound access to the credit card processor over TCP port 6868.
You should not recommend creating an application rule. Azure Firewall uses application rules to define internet resources that can be accessed from a subnet. In this scenario, if payment processing was handled over HTTP using the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) process.payments.com, for example, you could facilitate access to this FQDN using an application rule.

## Q009:

You need to recommend a solution for securely deploying lot sensors.
Which three forms of attestation should you include in your recommendation for confirming each sensor's identity? 

- Password hashes
- Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
- Symmetric keys
- X.509 certificates
- Biometrics
- Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

---

### Answer:
- Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
- Symmetric keys
- X.509 certificates

You should recommend using symmetric keys, Trusted Platform Modules (TPM), or X.509 certificates for the secure attestation of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. When you create an individual enrollment in Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS), you are presented with three attestation mechanisms: X.509, TPM, and Symmetric Key.
A symmetric key in DPS is a base-64 encoded string. You can define your own symmetric keys or let DPS do it for you. A symmetric key is comparable to a password and must be kept private in order to ensure security.
TPM defines a standard and mechanism for storing secrets in purpose-built hardware or firmware. TPM functionality can also be emulated in software, but this approach is much less secure and is not recommended for production deployments. Due to their design and rigorous testing, TPMs are well-suited to environments where stringent security is required.
X.509 is a standard for defining and creating certificates in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). An X.509 certificate can be self-generated or generated by a Certificate Authority (CA). A CA is a publicly trusted entity that uses its own methods for validating a certificate requestor prior to issuing the certificate. This allows an entity to present a certificate from a trusted third-party as a form of authentication.
You should not recommend using password hashes for the attestation of your lot sensors. Password hashes are irreversible strings created by hashing functions. Passwords are sometimes stored in hashed format to increase security. DPS does not support password hashes, but services like Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) do.
You should not recommend using Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for the attestation of your lot sensors. MFA is an authentication method in which a user is granted access only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence, or factors, to an authentication mechanism. The most common type of MFA combines something the user knows (such as a password) with something the user has (such as a code generated by an app on their phone). This is often referred to as two-factor authentication (2FA). Other types of MFA can include biometrics (something the user is), tokens, and smart cards. Azure AD supports MFA authentication. lot devices are not capable of providing multiple authentication factors.
You should not recommend using biometrics for the attestation of your lot sensors. Biometric authentication is a type of security that uses physical or behavioral characteristics to identify an individual. These characteristics can include fingerprints, retina scans, voice recognition, and facial recognition. Biometrics authentication relies on human characteristics, which lot devices cannot provide. Biometric authentication is considered more secure than traditional methods such as passwords and PINs because it is difficult to replicate physical or behavioral characteristics. Azure AD supports biometric
authentication.

## Q004-008:

> Background:

CompanyA is a health services company with its main offices in Chicago and Nashville. The company provides physical therapy services to clients in their homes, typically following surgical procedures or as part of workers' compensation claims. Currently, it relies on branch offices in multiple locations to support therapists but it is gradually transitioning to a full mobile work environment. To support this effort, it has initiated a company-wide migration of all critical services to the cloud. This migration includes on- premises servers, user VMs, and the supporting management and monitoring appliances.

> Current Environment:

CompanyA has initiated its cloud migration and establishes an Azure Azure AD tenant. This Azure AD tenant is synchronized with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), which is maintained on on-premises domain controllers. As the migration progresses, additional Azure subscriptions will be created on an as-needed basis for each department. To facilitate their daily work, most employees have access to Microsoft 365 applications.
To support continued connectivity, basic Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) testing has been initiated for most categories of employees, such as account managers, support staff, and business, finance, and HR staff. Secure connectivity is supported via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway for a limited set of users and devices. Additionally, a third-party firewall has been deployed to protect virtual server Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANS).
While they are on site with the clients, physical therapists use mobile devices with locally
stored tracking and monitoring data. This data is protected using proprietary storage
encryption, and each therapist is required to log on to their device using locally stored
credentials before accessing the data.

> Planned Changes:

As the cloud migration continues and expands, CompanyA plans to move all on-premises data to the cloud. The specific tasks planned for the next phase of the data migration include the following:
Client data:

- Protected Health Information (PHI) stored on mobile devices used by therapists will be moved to the cloud.

- Access to mobile devices while in the field should be restricted by geolocation.

- Data sharing between apps on the same device must be controlled.

- Compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other regulations must be maintained regardless of data storage or usage locations.

As data and processing is moved to Azure, the VPN gateway must be configured to support secure P2S connections from devices that run a variety of desktop and mobile operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Android, and others. This will require defining which protocols are available depending on the device or devices being used.
Basic Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) has been completed and CompanyA plans to
expand its Azure Virtual Desktop footprint. During the pilot phase of testing, an employee installed an application that was packaged with a polymorphic virus. The malware moved laterally to other VDI instances and exfiltrated proprietary company data. This issue must be addressed before any additional VMs are deployed.
As part of the migration, server operating systems must be standardized. Servers must meet the following requirements:

- When new systems are provisioned, a secure baseline must be ensured.

- During testing of a base server virtual machine (VM), a quick vulnerability scan discovered that the system responds on non-standard ports. Such vulnerabilities must be addressed prior to widespread use.

- Management is concerned about Secure Shell (SSH) access to the server VMs and wants to disable direct inbound internet access for this protocol. Remote administrative access must be supported without exposing SSH using a public IP.

---

## Q008:

You need to recommend a solution for protecting SSH access to server VMs.
What should you include in your recommendation?

- Network security groups
- Azure Bastion
- Forced tunneling
- Just-in-time access

---

### Answer:
- Azure Bastion

You should recommend the deployment of Azure Bastion. Azure Bastion provides secure, Transport Layer Security protected (TLS-protected) remote access to your Azure virtual machines (VMs) from anywhere in the world. Bastion enables you to establish a secure connection to your VMs without having to deploy and manage a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or expose the VMs with public IP addresses. In this scenario, once Bastion is deployed, administrators can connect to the Bastion host using TLS, where they will have Secure Shell (SSH) connectivity to Azure VMs.
You should not recommend the deployment of network security groups (NSGs). An NSG is a virtual networking element that enables you to control the inbound and outbound traffic to resources in a virtual network using IP addresses, protocols, and ports. NSGs can be used to close off parts of your network to all traffic, or they can be used to allow specific types of traffic, while blocking all other traffic.
You should not recommend the deployment of forced tunneling. Forced tunneling allows you to control
how internet-bound traffic is routed from a VNet. For example, you could direct traffic to an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) for deep packet inspection.
You should not recommend the deployment of just-in-time (JIT) access. JIT access requires the manual approval of every access attempt to specified ports on a VM. Each request comes with a limited lifetime, after which the ports are no longer reachable.

## Q007:

You need to recommend a solution for addressing the server vulnerabilities.
What should you recommend?

- Installing a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS)
- Deploying a network-based intrusion prevention system (NIPS) behind the server VLAN firewall
- Enabling data execution prevention on each server
- Uninstalling unused applications and services

---

### Answer:
- Uninstalling unused applications and services

You should recommend uninstalling unused applications and services. This is the best option for removing non-standard ports and reducing a server's attack surface. Among other sources, vulnerabilities are introduced by each application and service installed on a computer. Uninstalling these applications and services is known as system hardening.
You should not recommend installing a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS). This will not eliminate unnecessary ports and services. A HIDS detects and alerts you of malicious activity.
You should not recommend deploying a network-based intrusion prevention system (NIPS) behind the server VLAN firewall. A NIPS typically sits in-line between trusted and untrusted networks and is designed to detect and prevent malicious network activity. In this scenario, the firewall should already be providing NIPS functionality.
You should not recommend enabling data execution prevention (DEP) on each server. This will not remove non-standard ports and unnecessary services. Data execution prevention marks certain areas in memory as non-executable, which prevents malicious code from running.

## Q006:

You need to recommend a solution that will mitigate the risks presented by Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI).
For each mitigation requirement below, which solution should you recommend? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

To allow only reputable apps to run : WDAC
To manage apps that only run on Windows 8.1 : AppLocker
To block.ps1, .vbs, and .js scripts : AppLocker or WDAC
To control which apps a user can use : AppLocker

---

### Answer:

You should use Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) to allow only reputable apps to run. WDAC uses policies to protect systems by controlling the applications, drivers, and scripts that are allowed to run on a system. Each policy is composed of rules that allow or deny behaviors, based on conditions you specify. WDAC can be configured to use Microsoft's Intelligent Security Graph (ISG) to identify applications with known bad, known good, or unknown reputations.
You can use AppLocker to manage apps that run on Windows 8. AppLocker was introduced in Windows 7. WDAC is only available on Windows 10 or later and Windows Server 2016 or later.
You can use AppLocker or WDAC to block .ps1, .vbs, and .js scripts. PowerShell, Visual Basic, and JavaScript files are considered executables and can cause considerable harm if allowed to run without restrictions.
You can use AppLocker to control which apps a user can use. This means that on shared devices, one user can be allowed to use an application, while any other shared users are prevented from using the application. WDAC policies apply to all users on a device.

## Q005:

You need to specify which protocols are available for point-to-site (P2S) connections based on the operating system each client uses.
For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. 
Otherwise, select No.


Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, and macOS systems can connect using OpenVPN.
Planned Changes: Yes

Only Windows devices can connect using Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP). : Yes

Only Windows and macOS devices can connect using Internet Key Exchange version 2 Virtual Private Network (IKEv2 VPN). : No

---

### Answer:

Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, and macOS systems can connect using OpenVPN. Azure supports point-to- site (P2S) connections via Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateways. Azure deploys VPN gateways as fully managed virtual machines (VMs) that can scale up or down based on client load. VPN gateways support P2S and site-to-site (S2S) connectivity. OpenVPN is an open-source project and offers the broadest client support for P2S connectivity.
Only Windows devices can connect using Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP). SSTP is a type of VPN protocol that uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) for tunneling. It was introduced in Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008 and has been available in all subsequent versions of Windows.
As well as Windows and macOS devices, Linux, Android, and iOS devices can also connect using Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) VPN. Azure VPN gateways do not support IKEv2 connections from Windows clients. The goal of IKE is to establish, negotiate, and agree upon the parameters of an authenticated and encrypted key-exchange for use in setting up a secure communications channel, such as that used in a VPN.

## Q004:

You need to recommend a solution for managing client data stored on mobile devices.
Which two of the following should you include in your recommendation? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

- Conditional Access policies
- App protection policies (APP)
- User risk polices
- User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
- Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies

---

### Answer:
- Conditional Access policies
- App protection policies (APP)

You should recommend Conditional Access policies. Conditional Access is a security feature that helps you to control how users access your Azure resources. With conditional access, you can define the conditions under which users are allowed to access your resources and what actions they can take once they have accessed them. For example, you could allow users to access your resources only from certain locations or only during a certain timeframe.
You should also recommend app protection policies (APP). These are designed to protect apps and the data associated with those apps. This allows your organization's data, such as emails or files, to be protected when accessed from inside the app. APP can limit data sharing or prevent sharing altogether. Additionally, app-specific data can be encrypted. This way, if the device is lost or stolen, your organization's data remains safe.
You should not recommend User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA). UEBA is a Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps feature that can be used to detect anomalous user behavior that may indicate malicious activity. For example, if a user normally logs on between the hours of 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM, and then suddenly logs on from a new Internet Protocol (IP) address at 3:00 AM, Defender for Cloud Apps can be configured to generate an alert.
You should not recommend Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies. WDAC allows you to create a Windows environment in which only authorized applications can run on client computers. This helps to protect your systems from malicious or unapproved software.
You should not recommend user risk policies. User risk policies are designed to identify and alert on, or prevent risky user behavior. For example, a user attempting authentication using an anonymous Virtual Private Network (VPN).

## Q001-003:

Your organization is part of a consortium in which each member actively performs threat hunting on their internal networks and systems.
You need to design a solution that allows cyber threat intelligence (CTI) feed to be shared between member threat intelligence platforms (TIPs) automatically. You must ensure that the solution employs industry- accepted formats and protocols and that it is supported by Microsoft Sentinel.


## Q003:

Solution: You define an alert action on the TIP source and specify Microsoft Sentinel as the target product. You provide an application ID and client secret to the TIP source.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal. This solution requires a directory ID before data can be pushed from the threat intelligence platform (TIP) source to Sentinel. This process uses the Microsoft Graph indicators Application Programming Interface (API).

---

## Q002:

Solution: 

You retrieve the Application Programming Interface (API) Root and Collection ID for the TIP server and configure a data connector in your target workspace.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer: Yes

This solution meets the goal. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) can be aggregated using an on-premises or cloud-hosted threat intelligence platform (TIP). This information can then be fed to Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) systems and applications using rules and filters you define. Microsoft Sentinel can also ingest CTI using this approach.
This solution allows Microsoft Sentinel to pull CTI from a Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII) server. TAXII is an industry standard protocol that can be used to share CTI over Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). TAXII clients can push and receive CTI from a centralized TAXII server.

---

## Q001:

Solution: 

You register an app and grant Application 
Programming Interface (API) permissions to the app in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You use the client secret provided as part of the registration process to add the TIP source.

Does this solution meet the goal?
Yes - No

---

### Answer: NO

This solution does not meet the goal. This solution completes some of the steps required to configure an inbound Sentinel Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) feed. However, in addition to providing the client secret, you must also provide an application ID and directory ID. This information can be collected as part of the app registration process in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
