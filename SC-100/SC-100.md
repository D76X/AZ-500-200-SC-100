## Q022:

Your company hosts VM-based file, web, and database servers in the Azure cloud. You are concerned that employees accessing a general file server also have access to other servers that host sensitive information. Rather than deploy new permissions schemes on the servers, you want to mitigate this risk by ensuring the network design aligns with Zero Trust recommendations, as shown in the exhibit.

Your design must meet the following requirements:

- Limit user access to corporate file servers.
- Isolate other server workloads.
- Implement software-defined parameters.
- Reduce administrative overhead.

Which solution should you recommend?

Choose the correct answer

- The company should place each VM in an isolated VNet.
- The company should deploy VMs behind a jump box.
- The company should require a VPN for server access.
- The company should implement micro-segmentation.

---

### Answer:
- The company should implement micro-segmentation.

You should recommend implementing micro-segmentation. Micro-segmentation is a technique used for dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments. By doing this, you can further reduce the risk of data breaches and malware infections. With micro-segmentation, each segment is its own mini network with its own security controls. This isolates workloads, makes it much more difficult for attackers to move laterally within a network, and limits the impact of any breach.
You should not recommend placing each VM in an isolated virtual network (VNet). An Azure VNet is a private network in the cloud that you can use to deploy and manage your resources. A VNet provides you with an isolated and secure environment to run your applications and services. However, placing each VM in an isolated VNet is not part of Zero Trust and does not reduce administrative overhead. Common server VMs and their associated workloads can be located in the same VNet.
You should not recommend deploying VMs behind a jump box. A jump box is typically a hardened workstation that provides access to a secure network. In order to manage devices on the secure network, an administrator first connects to the jump box and then performs administrative tasks from that node. Jump boxes are also known as jump servers or bastion hosts.
You should not recommend requiring a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for server access. VPNs can be used to secure network communications, but this will not isolate the VMs from one another.

## Q021:

Your company provides custom API development services. The network and system administration team regularly builds and tears down testing and production environments to support these projects. Recently, a configuration error resulted in a breach that quickly spread to multiple environments.
You have been asked to design an Azure landing zone architecture that will reduce this risk in the future. You need to recommend a process or method for storing network and system configurations centrally in standardized files. Your approach should be based on DevSecOps best practices.
Which option should you include in your recommendation?

Choose the correct answer

- Infrastructure as code
- Continuous delivery
- Continuous integration
- Infrastructure automation

---

### Answer:
- Infrastructure as code

You should recommend implementing infrastructure as code (laC). laC is an infrastructure management methodology that stores network and system configurations centrally in standardized files. The primary benefit of using laC is the facilitation of network orchestration creating, testing, and reviewing code prior to deployment. The code is also deployed in a predictable, repeatable, and often automated way. Implementing laC also reduces the occurrence of configuration mistakes.
You should not recommend implementing infrastructure automation. Infrastructure automation aims to reduce errors by using scripts to automate repetitive tasks. Infrastructure automation does not store network and system configurations centrally in standardized files. Azure Automation can be used to facilitate infrastructure automation.
You should not recommend implementing continuous integration (CI). This is part of Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), which is designed to ensure that functional code can be deployed at any time during the development process. Cl means that code updates are made frequently. Cl does not store network and system configurations centrally in standardized files.
You should not recommend implementing continuous delivery (CD). This is the second piece of CI/CD. CD means that up-to-date code can be deployed at any time. CD does not store network and system configurations centrally in standardized files.

## Q020:

Your international company plans to gradually migrate subsidiary company platforms and applications to Azure. To ensure operational efficiency, reduce administrative overhead, and mitigate the risk of misconfigured services or systems, you have been tasked with implementing Azure landing zone architectures.
You must ensure that your design follows globally-accepted benchmarks, such as ISO 27001. Additionally, deployments must be applicable at scale and across multiple subscriptions.
Which option should you use to meet this goal?

Choose the correct answer

- Azure Blueprints
- Access packages
- Azure Policy
- Artifacts

---

### Answer:
- Azure Blueprints

You should use Azure Blueprints. Azure Blueprints is a service that helps you manage and deploy cloud resources at scale in a consistent and repeatable way. It provides a collection of templates and best practices that you can use to build your own cloud deployments and is a perfect companion to Azure landing zones. Azure Blueprints also support security and compliance governance activities, including ISO 27001. You can use this blueprint to deploy artifacts such as role assignments, resource groups, and policy assignments in an automated, orchestrated fashion.
You cannot use Azure Policy alone to meet this goal. Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you can use to create, assign, and manage policy definitions. Policy definitions specify what resources will be validated against the desired conditions. Azure Blueprints can include Azure policies, but this is not required.
You cannot use artifacts alone to meet this goal. Artifacts are components of blueprint definitions. Artifacts might include resource groups, role assignments, policy assignments, and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. Many artifacts can stand on their own, but only when contained in a blueprint definition can they be used to meet the goal stated in this scenario.
You should not use access packages. Access packages are used in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) identity governance to provide a user with the resource access they need to complete a project.

## Q019:

You are Cloud Security Engineer for an organization that has an existing Microsoft 365 and Azure tenant where you host your data estate. In a recent security incident, a member user inadvertently leaked sensitive information. This led the organization to conduct a full security review and policy assessment on all the Microsoft 365 and Azure estate.
The report highlighted that there were no existing data loss prevention (DLP) policies. Sensitive information was not clearly defined within the tenant, and no 'High Severity' DLP alerts were configured.
You need to create a policy that solves the issues listed in the report.

Which policy template should you use?

Choose the correct answer

- Risky user template
- Security policy violations
- Data theft by departing users
- Data Leaks template

---

### Answer:
- Data Leaks template

You should use the Data leaks template. This policy template requires you to configure a minimum of one Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies as well as define what is classified as sensitive information within your estate. You also configure it to receive insider risk alerts for 'High Severity' DLP policy alerts.
You should not use the Data theft by departing users template. This policy template requires you to configure the Microsoft 365 HR connector, which then imports resignation and termination date data for users within your estate.
You should not use the Security policy violation template. This policy template requires you to enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for insider risk management integration from within the Microsoft Defender Security Center. This then imports security violation alerts into the service.
You should not use the Risky users template. This policy template requires you to configure a Microsoft 365 HR connector, which then imports performance or demotion data for users within the company.

## Q018:

You are a Cloud Architect for an organization that hosts laaS, PaaS, and SaaS servicing within Azure and Microsoft Cloud. A recent security audit has made recommendations for the organization to start using the Zero Trust Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP) as an alternative to deployment guides to enable key layers of protection within the existing cloud estate.

You have the following services within the estate for which you need to adopt Zero Trust:

| Service type | Microsoft service name |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Identity     | Azure AD |
| Endpoints    | Intune     |
| DevOps       | Azure DevOps |
| IoT devices  | Azure IoT |
| Applications | Intune |

You need to ensure you prioritize the initiatives when following Zero Trust RaMP.
Which three service types should you look to modernize as a priority? 
Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

Choose the correct answers

- Identity
- Endpoints
- Applications
- DevOps

---

### Answer:
- Identity
- Endpoints
- Applications

You should modernize the Identity, Endpoint, and Application services first. The Zero Trust Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP) is an alternative to deployment guides that documents detailed configuration steps for all of the technology pillars that need to be protected by Zero Trust principles in Azure. There multiple initiatives that are categorized as 'Top Priority' and 'As needed'. The following initiatives are classed as 'Top Priority':
User access and productivity (this covers Identity, Endpoints, and Applications)
Data, compliance, and governance
Modernize security operations
You should not prioritize DevOps and lot devices as these are deemed to be 'As needed' within the RaMP and are covered by the following initiatives:
OT and Industrial IoT
Datacenter & DevOps Security

## Q017:

Your company purchases Surface laptops for all of its employees. The company requires that user systems be secured from emerging threats so you have recommended deploying Application Guard.
You need to enhance the security stance of each device.
Which two statements should you include in your recommendation? Each correct answer presents a complete the solution.
Choose the correct answers

- Application Guard relies on a locally installed Hyper-V instance to support security.
- Application Guard forces untrusted resources to be opened in a secure container.
- Application Guard is supported on end-user systems, including VDI deployments.
- Application Guard can be used to define domains that host trusted applications.
- Application Guard is only supported on systems running Windows 11 or later.

---

### Answer:
- Application Guard forces untrusted resources to be opened in a secure container.
- Application Guard can be used to define domains that host trusted applications.

Application Guard can be used to define domains that host trusted applications and forces untrusted resources to be opened in a secure container. Application Guard allows you to define domains and network ranges that host trusted applications, files, and web sites. Untrusted resources are opened in a Hyper-V container, or sandbox. This ensures that even if the resource contains or accesses malicious content, the local system will remain safe.
Application Guard is supported on end-user systems as long as those systems do not form part of a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) deployment. Application Guard is not supported for installation on VDI virtual machines (VMs).
Application Guard is supported on systems running Windows 10 or Windows 11. Application Guard can be installed on enterprise desktops, laptops, and Windows-based mobile devices.
Application Guard does not rely on a locally installed Hyper-V instance to support security. The Hyper-V container is maintained separately from the user's operating system.

## Q016:

You are an engineer for a small company that hosts it resources in a single Azure subscription. The company tenant has recently been subject to a systemic identity compromise attack where an attacker gained a foothold in Azure AD.

Your manager has asked you to map out the plan to respond to this attack and re-establish control of the Azure AD tenant without any additional third-party support.
Which four actions should you perform in sequence to meet the goal? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of possible actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.
Create a list in the correct order

Possible actions
Log a support ticket with Microsoft.
Scan for malicious files.
Isolate the bad actor.

Actions in order
Establish secure communications.
Investigate your environment.
Improve security posture.
Regain / retain control.


---

### Answer:

You should perform the following steps in order to respond to the systemic identity compromise attack and re-establish control of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant:
1. Establish secure communications
2. Investigate your environment
3. Improve security posture
4. Regain / retain control
The first step is to establish secure communications. Before taking any recovery action you should make sure that all members of the support team who are taking part in the investigation can securely communicate. Securing communications has to be your first step to allow you to proceed without the attacker's knowledge.
Next, you should investigate your environment. Once secure communications have been arranged for the main team members you should start looking into the attack, such as initial access points and persistence techniques.
Then, you should improve security posture for the tenant. You should enable security features and ensure you follow best practice guidelines and recommendations so you can improve security. You should also continue to monitor the environment as the security landscape changes.
Finally, you should regain / retain control of the environment. It is vital that you regain administrative control of Azure AD and the environment in general. Once you have control you need to ensure you refresh the estate's security posture and block all possible persistence techniques and new initial access exploits.
You should not log a support ticket with Microsoft. You would normally log a support ticket with Microsoft
for technical issues if parts of the estate are not working. However, it is not an essential part of the response plan and the scenario clearly states not to seek any third-party support.
You should not isolate the bad actor. Although as part of the investigation you may try to isolate the attacker, it is not a general step for the response to the attack.
You should not scan for malicious files. In the same way, scanning for malicious files may be a task that is completed as part of the remediation and improving security posture but it is not a general step within the response plan.

## Q013-Q015:

Your company uses Azure Synapse Analytics for data warehousing and data virtualization. Data analysts use the following Synapse resources:

- Dedicated SQL pools for big data analytics
- Serverless SQL endpoints for batch processing

You need to ensure that the Analytics deployment meets Azure Security Benchmark baseline requirements. Specifically, each Synapse resource should be accessible via a managed private endpoint.

---

## Q015:

Solution: You recommend deploying all SQL nodes in a common virtual network and that a P2S connection should be created between each endpoint and Azure Synapse Analytics.

Does this solution meet the goal?


---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal. Reaching Synapse resources via a managed private endpoint requires a Managed Virtual Network Workspace. This is a Synapse add-on feature that facilitates the creation of managed endpoints powerful compute nodes that are tailored to machine learning tasks. Point-to-Site (P2S) Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway connections are designed to connect a single endpoint to an Azure virtual network.

## Q014:

Solution: You recommend creating separate VNets for dedicated SQL pools and serverless SQL endpoints. VNets should be connected using Azure Express Route.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal. Reaching Synapse resources via a managed private endpoint requires a Managed Virtual Network Workspace. This is a Synapse add-on feature that facilitates the creation of managed endpoints powerful compute nodes that are tailored to machine learning tasks. In Azure, VNets are the basic building blocks for network segmentation and Azure Express Route lets you extend your on- premises and other-cloud networks into the Microsoft cloud over a secure, private connection.

## Q013:


Solution: 
You recommend creating a Managed Virtual Network Workspace and that all dedicated and serverless pools should be located in the workspace.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer: Yes

This solution meets the goal. Azure Synapse Analytics is an integrated Platform as a Service (PaaS) data platform that enables you to collect, clean, govern, analyze, and act on data in real time. It provides a single platform for data warehousing, big data analytics, and advanced analytics. Security for data stored in and processed by Synapse can be enhanced by implementing private endpoints. This approach is supported by the Azure Security Benchmark.
An Azure private endpoint is a network interface that connects your users privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. By deploying a Virtual Network Workspace for dedicated SQL pools and serverless SQL endpoints, you can ensure secure network segmentation. Data traversing a private link never traverses the public internet.

## Q009-Q012:

> Overview

CompanyA is an online e-tailer that specializes in high-end fashion and accessories. In the past, CompanyA worked with clothing manufactures to drop ship purchases to customers, allowing it to focus on maintaining a lightweight online presence. However, it has recently acquired several boutique clothing manufacturers and wants to bring these acquisitions into the CompanyA environment as quickly as possible. This will require CompanyA to expand operations from strictly online sales and marketing to manufacturing and delivery. Additionally, the company has experienced dramatic expansion into European and Asian markets and wants to consolidate diverse on- premises and cloud resources in Azure.

> Existing Environment

CompanyA hosts all e-commerce servers in an on-premises data center located in North America. Its customers reside across the world and many of them use the CompanyA mobile app to browse and purchase items. This app sends requests to an API endpoint using HTTP or HTTPS. When a customer completes a purchase, a third-party transaction server connects to a remote credit card processor over TCP 6868. Backend data is stored on a custom Microsoft database and CompanyA has hired a remote DBA contractor to manage the database platform using RDP.
The current e-commerce site was recently hacked and an attacker was able to modify the descriptions for many products. A third-party security consulting firm was hired to perform an investigation and confirmed that the attacker modified the underlying database information.
Systems for the recently acquired clothing manufacturers are also hosted on-premises. These databases store clothing patterns and designs in document databases.

> Requirements

The existing e-commerce platform must be migrated to Azure. Once complete, access to the migrated workload must be protected by strict inbound and outbound traffic rules. It is anticipated that this functionality will be provided by Azure Firewall.
CompanyA is committed to a green, climate-friendly operation and has publicly announced that it will be carbon-neutral within three years. To comply with this goal, it plans to deploy loT sensors in the recently acquired clothing manufacturing plants. The sensors will monitor environmental conditions, including power consumption. Additionally, the sensors will monitor resource consumption, which will aid in procuring raw materials for the manufacturing process. As the sensors will have access to CompanyA's intellectual property, they must be secured from tampering. It is anticipated that these sensors will be managed by Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS).
Given the recent database attack, CompanyA's management wants to ensure that the migrated system is secure and not susceptible to similar attacks in the future.
Clothing designs and patterns must be migrated to CosmosDB. To maximize security, this database must be segmented from other network traffic. The design for this database must meet the following requirements:

- On-premises analysts must have access to data stored in Cosmos DB.
- All network traffic must be segmented from the internet.
- Resource access must be mappable to a single database instance.


---

## Q012:

You need to design a solution for access to CosmosDB.
The solution should meet the following requirements:

- To extend your on-premises network into Azure, bypassing the internet
- To provide access to a single database instance

Which two technologies or components should you recommend for each stated requirement? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

- Virtual network TAP
- Service endpoint
- Private Link
- Express Route

---

### Answer:
- Private Link
- Express Route

To bypass the internet and extend your on-premises network into Azure, you should recommend the deployment of Express Route. Azure ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises and other-cloud networks into the Microsoft cloud over a secure, private connection. You can create hybrid applications and architectures that include both cloud and on-premises services, and you can use Express Route to bypass the public internet and improve network performance.
To provide access to a single database instance, you should recommend the deployment of Private Link. Azure Private Link is a service that enables customers to securely access Azure platform as a service (PaaS) resources over a private endpoint hosted in their virtual network. Traffic between the customer's network and Azure services traverses over the Microsoft backbone, eliminating exposure from the internet. Customers can also leverage Private Link to break out egress traffic from an on-premises network using Express Route.
You should not recommend using a service endpoint. Service endpoints facilitate secure access to Azure resources from your virtual network. However, service endpoints are not used to provide access for on- premises users.
You should not recommend using a virtual network Terminal Access Point (TAP). An Azure VNet TAP allows you to passively monitor traffic sent between nodes by mirroring network traffic to a monitoring device for further analysis.

## Q011:

You must secure the e-commerce database.
What should you include in your recommendation?

- The web development team should run all submitted user requests through a link checker.
- The web development team should add input validation functions to the shopping cart page.
- The system security team should require TLS on all servers that host web content.
- The DBA should enable data execution prevention on all servers hosting website data.

---

### Answer:
- The web development team should add input validation functions to the shopping cart page.

The web development team should add input validation functions to the shopping cart page. In this scenario, the e-commerce platform has suffered a Structured Query Language (SQL) injection attack that has allowed a malicious user to modify database content. SQL injection occurs when malicious SQL statements are inserted into an application or website field. A SQL injection attack is designed to exploit application vulnerabilities and extract, modify, or delete database information. Input validation prevents such statements from executing against a database. Tools like Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) can perform input validation.
The web development team should not run all submitted user requests through a link checker. Link checking is used to mitigate phishing and other similar attacks by verifying that links in emails and documents are authentic and not malicious. Tools like Microsoft Defender verify links using a technique known as Uniform Resource Locator (URL) scanning.
The system security team should not require Transport Layer Security (TLS) on all servers that host web content. Transport encryption methods, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), are used to ensure that data is encrypted as it travels between endpoints. Although this is best practice and is normally followed, it is not the ideal approach to mitigate the risk in this scenario.
The database administrator (DBA) should not enable data execution prevention on all servers hosting website data. Data execution prevention (DEP) marks certain areas in memory as non-executable, which prevents malicious code from running. DEP protects against buffer overflow attacks; it does not mitigate injection attacks.

## Q010:

You need to design a solution that ensures that the e-commerce application is secure.
Which Azure Firewall rule type should you recommend to meet each requirement? To answer, select the appropriate options from the drop-down menus.

To facilitate customer access to the API endpoint:
DNAT rule and network rule

To facilitate contractor access to the database server:
DNAT rule and network rule

To facilitate transaction server access to the credit card processor:
Network rule

---

### Answer:

To facilitate customer access to the Application Programming Interface (API) endpoint, you should recommend creating a destination network address translation (DNAT) rule and a network rule. DNAT rules facilitate translation from a public firewall address and port to a private IP and port. This approach is commonly used to provide access to resources configured with private IPs. A network rule is a traditional layer 3/layer 4 rule based on protocols (TCP or UDP), ports, and IP addresses. While the DNAT rule facilitates network translation, the network rule allows the specified access to the API endpoint over ports 80 and 443.
To facilitate contractor access to the database server, you should recommend creating a DNAT rule and a
network rule. As with the API endpoint, inbound access to the database server's IP will require DNAT, and the network rule will be configured to allow TCP access over the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port, 3389.
To facilitate transaction server access to the credit card processor, you should recommend creating a network rule. The network rule will allow outbound access to the credit card processor over TCP port 6868.
You should not recommend creating an application rule. Azure Firewall uses application rules to define internet resources that can be accessed from a subnet. In this scenario, if payment processing was handled over HTTP using the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) process.payments.com, for example, you could facilitate access to this FQDN using an application rule.

## Q009:

You need to recommend a solution for securely deploying lot sensors.
Which three forms of attestation should you include in your recommendation for confirming each sensor's identity? 

- Password hashes
- Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
- Symmetric keys
- X.509 certificates
- Biometrics
- Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

---

### Answer:
- Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
- Symmetric keys
- X.509 certificates

You should recommend using symmetric keys, Trusted Platform Modules (TPM), or X.509 certificates for the secure attestation of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. When you create an individual enrollment in Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS), you are presented with three attestation mechanisms: X.509, TPM, and Symmetric Key.
A symmetric key in DPS is a base-64 encoded string. You can define your own symmetric keys or let DPS do it for you. A symmetric key is comparable to a password and must be kept private in order to ensure security.
TPM defines a standard and mechanism for storing secrets in purpose-built hardware or firmware. TPM functionality can also be emulated in software, but this approach is much less secure and is not recommended for production deployments. Due to their design and rigorous testing, TPMs are well-suited to environments where stringent security is required.
X.509 is a standard for defining and creating certificates in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). An X.509 certificate can be self-generated or generated by a Certificate Authority (CA). A CA is a publicly trusted entity that uses its own methods for validating a certificate requestor prior to issuing the certificate. This allows an entity to present a certificate from a trusted third-party as a form of authentication.
You should not recommend using password hashes for the attestation of your lot sensors. Password hashes are irreversible strings created by hashing functions. Passwords are sometimes stored in hashed format to increase security. DPS does not support password hashes, but services like Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) do.
You should not recommend using Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for the attestation of your lot sensors. MFA is an authentication method in which a user is granted access only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence, or factors, to an authentication mechanism. The most common type of MFA combines something the user knows (such as a password) with something the user has (such as a code generated by an app on their phone). This is often referred to as two-factor authentication (2FA). Other types of MFA can include biometrics (something the user is), tokens, and smart cards. Azure AD supports MFA authentication. lot devices are not capable of providing multiple authentication factors.
You should not recommend using biometrics for the attestation of your lot sensors. Biometric authentication is a type of security that uses physical or behavioral characteristics to identify an individual. These characteristics can include fingerprints, retina scans, voice recognition, and facial recognition. Biometrics authentication relies on human characteristics, which lot devices cannot provide. Biometric authentication is considered more secure than traditional methods such as passwords and PINs because it is difficult to replicate physical or behavioral characteristics. Azure AD supports biometric
authentication.

## Q004-008:

> Background:

CompanyA is a health services company with its main offices in Chicago and Nashville. The company provides physical therapy services to clients in their homes, typically following surgical procedures or as part of workers' compensation claims. Currently, it relies on branch offices in multiple locations to support therapists but it is gradually transitioning to a full mobile work environment. To support this effort, it has initiated a company-wide migration of all critical services to the cloud. This migration includes on- premises servers, user VMs, and the supporting management and monitoring appliances.

> Current Environment:

CompanyA has initiated its cloud migration and establishes an Azure Azure AD tenant. This Azure AD tenant is synchronized with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), which is maintained on on-premises domain controllers. As the migration progresses, additional Azure subscriptions will be created on an as-needed basis for each department. To facilitate their daily work, most employees have access to Microsoft 365 applications.
To support continued connectivity, basic Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) testing has been initiated for most categories of employees, such as account managers, support staff, and business, finance, and HR staff. Secure connectivity is supported via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway for a limited set of users and devices. Additionally, a third-party firewall has been deployed to protect virtual server Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANS).
While they are on site with the clients, physical therapists use mobile devices with locally
stored tracking and monitoring data. This data is protected using proprietary storage
encryption, and each therapist is required to log on to their device using locally stored
credentials before accessing the data.

> Planned Changes:

As the cloud migration continues and expands, CompanyA plans to move all on-premises data to the cloud. The specific tasks planned for the next phase of the data migration include the following:
Client data:

- Protected Health Information (PHI) stored on mobile devices used by therapists will be moved to the cloud.

- Access to mobile devices while in the field should be restricted by geolocation.

- Data sharing between apps on the same device must be controlled.

- Compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other regulations must be maintained regardless of data storage or usage locations.

As data and processing is moved to Azure, the VPN gateway must be configured to support secure P2S connections from devices that run a variety of desktop and mobile operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Android, and others. This will require defining which protocols are available depending on the device or devices being used.
Basic Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) has been completed and CompanyA plans to
expand its Azure Virtual Desktop footprint. During the pilot phase of testing, an employee installed an application that was packaged with a polymorphic virus. The malware moved laterally to other VDI instances and exfiltrated proprietary company data. This issue must be addressed before any additional VMs are deployed.
As part of the migration, server operating systems must be standardized. Servers must meet the following requirements:

- When new systems are provisioned, a secure baseline must be ensured.

- During testing of a base server virtual machine (VM), a quick vulnerability scan discovered that the system responds on non-standard ports. Such vulnerabilities must be addressed prior to widespread use.

- Management is concerned about Secure Shell (SSH) access to the server VMs and wants to disable direct inbound internet access for this protocol. Remote administrative access must be supported without exposing SSH using a public IP.

---

## Q008:

You need to recommend a solution for protecting SSH access to server VMs.
What should you include in your recommendation?

- Network security groups
- Azure Bastion
- Forced tunneling
- Just-in-time access

---

### Answer:
- Azure Bastion

You should recommend the deployment of Azure Bastion. Azure Bastion provides secure, Transport Layer Security protected (TLS-protected) remote access to your Azure virtual machines (VMs) from anywhere in the world. Bastion enables you to establish a secure connection to your VMs without having to deploy and manage a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or expose the VMs with public IP addresses. In this scenario, once Bastion is deployed, administrators can connect to the Bastion host using TLS, where they will have Secure Shell (SSH) connectivity to Azure VMs.
You should not recommend the deployment of network security groups (NSGs). An NSG is a virtual networking element that enables you to control the inbound and outbound traffic to resources in a virtual network using IP addresses, protocols, and ports. NSGs can be used to close off parts of your network to all traffic, or they can be used to allow specific types of traffic, while blocking all other traffic.
You should not recommend the deployment of forced tunneling. Forced tunneling allows you to control
how internet-bound traffic is routed from a VNet. For example, you could direct traffic to an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) for deep packet inspection.
You should not recommend the deployment of just-in-time (JIT) access. JIT access requires the manual approval of every access attempt to specified ports on a VM. Each request comes with a limited lifetime, after which the ports are no longer reachable.

## Q007:

You need to recommend a solution for addressing the server vulnerabilities.
What should you recommend?

- Installing a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS)
- Deploying a network-based intrusion prevention system (NIPS) behind the server VLAN firewall
- Enabling data execution prevention on each server
- Uninstalling unused applications and services

---

### Answer:
- Uninstalling unused applications and services

You should recommend uninstalling unused applications and services. This is the best option for removing non-standard ports and reducing a server's attack surface. Among other sources, vulnerabilities are introduced by each application and service installed on a computer. Uninstalling these applications and services is known as system hardening.
You should not recommend installing a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS). This will not eliminate unnecessary ports and services. A HIDS detects and alerts you of malicious activity.
You should not recommend deploying a network-based intrusion prevention system (NIPS) behind the server VLAN firewall. A NIPS typically sits in-line between trusted and untrusted networks and is designed to detect and prevent malicious network activity. In this scenario, the firewall should already be providing NIPS functionality.
You should not recommend enabling data execution prevention (DEP) on each server. This will not remove non-standard ports and unnecessary services. Data execution prevention marks certain areas in memory as non-executable, which prevents malicious code from running.

## Q006:

You need to recommend a solution that will mitigate the risks presented by Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI).
For each mitigation requirement below, which solution should you recommend? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

To allow only reputable apps to run : WDAC
To manage apps that only run on Windows 8.1 : AppLocker
To block.ps1, .vbs, and .js scripts : AppLocker or WDAC
To control which apps a user can use : AppLocker

---

### Answer:

You should use Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) to allow only reputable apps to run. WDAC uses policies to protect systems by controlling the applications, drivers, and scripts that are allowed to run on a system. Each policy is composed of rules that allow or deny behaviors, based on conditions you specify. WDAC can be configured to use Microsoft's Intelligent Security Graph (ISG) to identify applications with known bad, known good, or unknown reputations.
You can use AppLocker to manage apps that run on Windows 8. AppLocker was introduced in Windows 7. WDAC is only available on Windows 10 or later and Windows Server 2016 or later.
You can use AppLocker or WDAC to block .ps1, .vbs, and .js scripts. PowerShell, Visual Basic, and JavaScript files are considered executables and can cause considerable harm if allowed to run without restrictions.
You can use AppLocker to control which apps a user can use. This means that on shared devices, one user can be allowed to use an application, while any other shared users are prevented from using the application. WDAC policies apply to all users on a device.

## Q005:

You need to specify which protocols are available for point-to-site (P2S) connections based on the operating system each client uses.
For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. 
Otherwise, select No.


Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, and macOS systems can connect using OpenVPN.
Planned Changes: Yes

Only Windows devices can connect using Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP). : Yes

Only Windows and macOS devices can connect using Internet Key Exchange version 2 Virtual Private Network (IKEv2 VPN). : No

---

### Answer:

Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, and macOS systems can connect using OpenVPN. Azure supports point-to- site (P2S) connections via Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateways. Azure deploys VPN gateways as fully managed virtual machines (VMs) that can scale up or down based on client load. VPN gateways support P2S and site-to-site (S2S) connectivity. OpenVPN is an open-source project and offers the broadest client support for P2S connectivity.
Only Windows devices can connect using Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP). SSTP is a type of VPN protocol that uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) for tunneling. It was introduced in Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008 and has been available in all subsequent versions of Windows.
As well as Windows and macOS devices, Linux, Android, and iOS devices can also connect using Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) VPN. Azure VPN gateways do not support IKEv2 connections from Windows clients. The goal of IKE is to establish, negotiate, and agree upon the parameters of an authenticated and encrypted key-exchange for use in setting up a secure communications channel, such as that used in a VPN.

## Q004:

You need to recommend a solution for managing client data stored on mobile devices.
Which two of the following should you include in your recommendation? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

- Conditional Access policies
- App protection policies (APP)
- User risk polices
- User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
- Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies

---

### Answer:
- Conditional Access policies
- App protection policies (APP)

You should recommend Conditional Access policies. Conditional Access is a security feature that helps you to control how users access your Azure resources. With conditional access, you can define the conditions under which users are allowed to access your resources and what actions they can take once they have accessed them. For example, you could allow users to access your resources only from certain locations or only during a certain timeframe.
You should also recommend app protection policies (APP). These are designed to protect apps and the data associated with those apps. This allows your organization's data, such as emails or files, to be protected when accessed from inside the app. APP can limit data sharing or prevent sharing altogether. Additionally, app-specific data can be encrypted. This way, if the device is lost or stolen, your organization's data remains safe.
You should not recommend User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA). UEBA is a Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps feature that can be used to detect anomalous user behavior that may indicate malicious activity. For example, if a user normally logs on between the hours of 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM, and then suddenly logs on from a new Internet Protocol (IP) address at 3:00 AM, Defender for Cloud Apps can be configured to generate an alert.
You should not recommend Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies. WDAC allows you to create a Windows environment in which only authorized applications can run on client computers. This helps to protect your systems from malicious or unapproved software.
You should not recommend user risk policies. User risk policies are designed to identify and alert on, or prevent risky user behavior. For example, a user attempting authentication using an anonymous Virtual Private Network (VPN).

## Q001-003:

Your organization is part of a consortium in which each member actively performs threat hunting on their internal networks and systems.
You need to design a solution that allows cyber threat intelligence (CTI) feed to be shared between member threat intelligence platforms (TIPs) automatically. You must ensure that the solution employs industry- accepted formats and protocols and that it is supported by Microsoft Sentinel.


## Q003:

Solution: You define an alert action on the TIP source and specify Microsoft Sentinel as the target product. You provide an application ID and client secret to the TIP source.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal. This solution requires a directory ID before data can be pushed from the threat intelligence platform (TIP) source to Sentinel. This process uses the Microsoft Graph indicators Application Programming Interface (API).

---

## Q002:

Solution: 

You retrieve the Application Programming Interface (API) Root and Collection ID for the TIP server and configure a data connector in your target workspace.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer: Yes

This solution meets the goal. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) can be aggregated using an on-premises or cloud-hosted threat intelligence platform (TIP). This information can then be fed to Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) systems and applications using rules and filters you define. Microsoft Sentinel can also ingest CTI using this approach.
This solution allows Microsoft Sentinel to pull CTI from a Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII) server. TAXII is an industry standard protocol that can be used to share CTI over Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). TAXII clients can push and receive CTI from a centralized TAXII server.

---

## Q001:

Solution: 

You register an app and grant Application 
Programming Interface (API) permissions to the app in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You use the client secret provided as part of the registration process to add the TIP source.

Does this solution meet the goal?
Yes - No

---

### Answer: NO

This solution does not meet the goal. This solution completes some of the steps required to configure an inbound Sentinel Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) feed. However, in addition to providing the client secret, you must also provide an application ID and directory ID. This information can be collected as part of the app registration process in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
