## Q002:

Your organization has a subscription that hosts resources for multiple applications in Azure. The subscription is part of a tenant that has synchronization enabled using Microsoft Entra Connect with on- premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). The resources for each application are contained in individual resource groups.
As additional users are added to the application teams, you add roles for those users at the resource group level. Users can manage multiple applications.
You need to efficiently manage the permissions that are assigned to the Microsoft Entra users for them to access these resource groups.
Solution: You create security groups in AD DS, add users to these groups, and assign roles to the groups at the resource group level.
Does the solution meet the goal?

## Q001:

Your organization has a subscription that hosts resources for 
multiple applications in Azure. 
The subscription is part of a tenant that has synchronization enabled 
using Microsoft Entra Connect with on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). 

The resources for each application are contained in individual resource groups.

As additional users are added to the application teams, 
you add roles for those users at the resource group level. 
Users can manage multiple applications.

You need to efficiently manage the permissions that are assigned 
to the Microsoft Entra users for them to access these resource groups.

Solution: 

You create Microsoft Entra groups for each application, 
add users to these groups, 
and assign roles to the groups at the resource group level.

Does the solution meet the goal?

### Answer: Yes

This solution meets the goal. 

Creating Microsoft Entra groups provides centralized user management of groups of users rather than individual users. 

When the group is provided permissions at the resource group level, all users in the group inherit the permissions provided to the group. 

To add or remove permissions for a given user, you would just add or remove them from the corresponding Microsoft Entra group. 

Roles are a collection of permissions, while groups are a collection of users. 
With groups, you are able to manage a collection of permissions 
for a collection of users, which eases the management of both 
the permissions and the users.
