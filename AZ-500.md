## Q014:

You are an Azure administrator for a multi-tenant Microsoft Entra ID.
You need to provide users in Microsoft Entra Tenant1 access to resources in Microsoft Entra Tenant2.
Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of possible actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.

Send the Microsoft Entra Tenant1 users an invite from Tenant2.
Choose a Microsoft Entra identity provider for authentication.
Ensure that the Microsoft Entra Tenant1 users accept the invite.
Choose a Microsoft Account (MSA) identity provider for authentication.
Choose an email one-time passcode for authentication.
Choose a SAML/WS-Fed identity provider for authentication.

---

### Answer:

Send the Microsoft Entra Tenant1 users an invite from Tenant2.
Ensure that the Microsoft Entra Tenant1 users accept the invite.
Choose a Microsoft Entra identity provider for authentication.

For users from Microsoft Entra Tenant1 to be able to access resources in Microsoft Entra Tenant2, you should send an invite from Tenant2 first. You can do so in the Microsoft Entra ID portal by navigating to the Users menu, selecting Invite user, er, and adding guest user information.
Next, you should ensure that Microsoft Entra Tenant1 users accept the invite. This is needed so that users from Tenant1 can access resources in Tenant2.
Finally, you should choose a Microsoft Entra identity provider. Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity management service that provides user authentication services for Azure resources, Microsoft 365 resources, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. Both tenants in the scenario are Microsoft Entra tenants, so you should use a Microsoft Entra identity provider. Users with Microsoft Entra accounts in an external Microsoft Entra tenant can be invited via email. After accepting the invitation, they can sign into the resources Microsoft Entra tenant without any further configuration.
You should not choose an MSA identity provider. MSA is an identity provider used for Microsoft's consumer products, such as Xbox LIVE, Outlook, etc. In this case, the organization's accounts reside in Microsoft Entra ID, which implies that users cannot authenticate using MSA.
You should not choose an SAML/WS-Fed identity provider. If the partner organization's identity provider is neither Microsoft Entra ID nor MSA, you can set up a custom authentication flow using the SAM/WS-Fed protocol. This could be the case if a partner's accounts reside in Active Directory (AD) on-premises.
You should not choose an email one-time passcode for authentication. This authentication mechanism can be used for external identities if they cannot be authenticated using any of the available identity providers.

## Q011-013:

You have an Azure SQL Server instance in your subscription. Your passwords for the SQL Server instance are stored in a key vault.
Your organization has password rotation policies that require all SQL passwords to expire every three months. You decide to automate the password rotation in your key vault three days before the password is about to expire.
You need to implement this automation.

---

Solution: 
You create an Azure function with an Event Grid Trigger and configure the Key Vault Event Grid as the source.
Does the solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer: Yes

This solution meets the goal. 

To automate key rotation, you have to write a custom function that can first create a new key in the key vault and then update the SQL password. Since the old password would not yet have expired, applications that use SQL Server as the data source would still function as long as they have the password cached. Once the password is rotated, the applications would retrieve the new password from the key vault.

---

### References:

[Automate the rotation of a secret for resources that use one set of authentication credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/tutorial-rotation)  

---

Solution: 
You trigger an email to the SQL administrator when the password is about to expire. 
The administrator will update both the key vault and the SQL server with the new password using the Azure Command Line Interface (CLI).

Does the solution meet the goal?

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal. 

The requirements state to automate the password rotation process. Even though this solution will automate the notification of the expiration, it will not automate the password rotation. The Azure CLI would have to be executed by the SQL Server administrator.

---

### References:

[Automate the rotation of a secret for resources that use one set of authentication credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/tutorial-rotation)  

---

Solution: 
You create a PowerShell runbook in an Azure Automation account and schedule it to run every 90
days.

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal. 

The PowerShell runbook would provide the necessary automation for rotating the password, but the trigger is fixed at 90 days. Since you decide to rotate the password three days before the expiration date, it will not always be a 90-day interval.

## Q008-010:

You have a hybrid configuration of Microsoft Entra ID.
You have an Azure storage account with a file share named `fileshare01`.
You plan to allow users to authenticate to `fileshare01` by using their Microsoft Entra credentials.
You need to configure the environment to support the planned authentication.

--- 

Solution: You assign the Storage File Data SMB Shar Contributor role to the users.
Does this solution meet the goal?

--

### Answer: Yes

This solution meets the goal. 

Azure Storage supports access to Azure files storage resources using Microsoft Entra credentials. To authorize your users you should assign to their account one of the following role based access control (RBAC) roles:

â€¢ Storage File Data SMB Share Reader: This role allows users to read files and directories in file shares over SMB.
Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor: This role allows users to read, write, and delete files and directories in file shares over SMB.
Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor: This role allows users to read, write, delete, and modify Windows ACLs in file shares over SMB.

Solution: You deploy Microsoft Entra application proxy.
Does this solution meet the goal?

--

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal. 

You should use Microsoft Entra Application Proxy to provide secure remote access to web applications hosted on-premises from a remote client. 

You can enable single sign-on (SSO) with Application Proxy. However, you cannot allow users to authenticate to the fileshare01 file share with Application Proxy.

Solution: You deploy the on-premises data gateway in the on-premises network.
Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal. 

You should not deploy an on-premises data gateway in the on- premises network. 

An on-premises data gateway provides quick and secure data transfer between on- premises data and several Microsoft cloud services, like Power BI, PowerApps, and Azure Logic Apps.

## Q004-007:

Company1 is a financial firm that specializes in crypto currencies. 

Company1 applications are developed in Docker containers and deployed 
to Azure virtual machines (VMs) in an Azure subscription named `Cloud`.

`Cloud` is associated with a Microsoft Entra tenant named `company1.net`.

`Cloud` contains the resources provisioned in four resource groups, 
as shown in the table below:

| Name       | Resource Group | Description                                          |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| VNET1      | RG1            | Azure Virtual Network with address space 10.0.0.0/16 |
| Sub1       | RG1            | Subnet from VNET1 for prod environment with address 10.0.0.0/24  |
| Sub2       | RG1            | Subnet from VNET1 for dev environment with address 10.0.1.0/24  |
| VM1        | RG1            | Azure VM for production environment                 |
| VM2        | RG2            | Azure VM for development environment                |
| VM3        | RG3            | Azure VM running MySQL database for production      |
| VM4        | RG3            | Azure VM running MySQL database for development     |
| Storage1   | RG3            | Production Storage Account                          |
| Storage2   | RG3            | Development Storage Account                         |
| Registry1  | RG4            | Azure Container Registry for all images              |

The Azure VMs are associated with the subnets as shown below:

| Virtual Machine | Network Interface | Subnet |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
| VM1             | NIC1              | Sub1 |
| VM3             | NIC3              | Sub1 |
| VM2             | NIC2              | Sub2 |
| VM4             | NIC4              | Sub2 |

The following table shows the users contained in the tenant `company1.net`,
along with their attached roled in the `Cloud`. 

| User   | Role           |
|--------|----------------|
| User1  | Contributor    |
| User2  | AcrPull        |
| User3  | AcrPush        |
| User4  | AcrlmageSigner |      

`Cloud` contains resource group locks, as shown in the table below:

| Name  | Set on | Lock type |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Lock1 | RG1    | Delete    |
| Lock2 | RG3    | Delete    |
| Lock3 | RG3    | Read-only |
| Lock4 | RG4    | Delete    |

`Cloud` also contains the Azure policies shown in the table below:

| Policy                     | Resource type    | Scope |
|----------------------------|------------------|-------|
| Not allowed resource types | registries       | RG1 |
| Allowed resource types     | virtual Machines | RG2 |
| Not allowed resource types | registries       | RG3 |
| Not allowed resource types | virtual Machines | RG4 |

**Storage2** has its firewall enabled.

---

## Requirements:

â€¢ A new user named `User5` is created in `company1.net`. 
This user needs permission to push and pull trusted images to a container registry.

â€¢ A new user named `User6` is created in `company1.net`. 
This user has the Owner role in `Cloud`.

â€¢ `Registry1` needs to be private and protected by authentication.

â€¢ The push operation in `Registry1` needs to be audited at the user level.

â€¢ The images in `Registry1` need to be frequently scanned for vulnerabilities.

â€¢ Azure-managed services need to be used whenever possible to reduce
administrative efforts. 

â€¢ Network access to `VM3` needs to be restricted to `VM1` only.

â€¢ Network access to `Storage1` needs to be restricted to `Sub1` only.

â€¢ Network access restrictions need to be applied at the resource level only.


---

## Q007

You create `User6` and assign them the `Owner` role at the `Cloud` subscription level.
In which resource groups could `User6` create a new Azure virtual machine?

- RG2 only
- RG1 only
- RG1, RG2 only
- RG1, RG2, RG3 only

> Relevant information:


> Relevant Requirements:
â€¢ A new user named `User6` is created in `company1.net`. 
This user has the Owner role in `Cloud`.


---

### Answer: RG1, RG2 only


Even if a user is assigned the Owner role in a subscription, resource group locks and Azure Policy are applied.

User6 could provision an Azure VM in resource groups RG1 and RG2 only. The Azure policy on RG2 allows only VMs to be provisioned, and the policy in RG1 only restricts the container registry to be provisioned.
User6 could not provision any resources to RG3 because a ReadOnly lock is enabled in this resource group. The delete lock type applied to other resource groups does not restrict you from provisioning new resources. You are only restricted from deleting the existing resources.

## Q006:

You need to restrict network access to resources in Cloud as specified in the requirements.

Which network service should you use to restrict network access for `Storage1` and `VM3`? 

---

### Answer:

Storage1: Resource firewall
VM3: NSG

- You should use a resource firewall for Storage1. 

> Relevant information:

| Name       | Resource Group | Description                                          |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Storage1   | RG3            | Production Storage Account                          |

> Relevant Requirements:
â€¢ Network access to `Storage1` needs to be restricted to `Sub1` only.
â€¢ Network access restrictions need to be applied at the resource level only.

**Storage account resource firewalls** restrict access to the storage account public endpoint. 
**By default, all networks are allowed in the resource firewall**. 

You can select a virtual network (VNet) or IP range to restrict network access directly in `Storage1`. 
You can configure Storage1 to allow traffic only from the `Sub1` subnet.

- An NSG is needed for VM3

| Name       | Resource Group | Description                                          |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| VM3        | RG3            | Azure VM running MySQL database for production      |

| Virtual Machine | Network Interface | Subnet |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
| VM3             | NIC3              | Sub1 |

> Relevant Requirements:

â€¢ Network access to `VM3` needs to be restricted to `VM1` only.
â€¢ Network access restrictions need to be applied at the resource level only.

An NSG contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic in Azure. 
An NSG can be attached directly to an Azure VM, and you can create a security rule to allow inbound traffic only from VM1 using a private IP address.

> The following do not apply:

- You should not use Azure Firewall

This is a **managed network security service** from Azure that **protects the Azure Virtual Network (VNet)**. 
You can use Azure Firewall to centralize network connectivity policies in your VNets. 
However, **Azure Firewall is a separate resource that is not applied directly at the resource level**.

- You should not use a network appliance. 

You can deploy network appliance solutions from the Azure marketplace and configure the centralized 
network connectivity policies in your VNets. 
Managing an Azure VM with the network appliance will also increase the required administrative effort.

## Q005:

You need to ensure that the Docker containers running on VM2 can 
access Storage2 over the Microsoft backbone network only.

What should you do before you create a Docker container on VM2?

- Create a private endpoint for Storage2 and connect it to the Sub2.
- Create an application security group (ASG) and a network security group (NSG).
- Move Storage2 to RG2.
- Install the container network interface (CNI) plug-in.

The relevant information from the question and requirements sections:

| Virtual Machine | Network Interface | Subnet |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
| VM2             | NIC2              | Sub2 |

| Name       | Resource Group | Description                                          |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| VNET1      | RG1            | Azure Virtual Network with address space 10.0.0.0/16 |
| Sub2       | RG1            | Subnet from VNET1 for dev environment with address 10.0.1.0/24  |
| VM2        | RG2            | Azure VM for development environment                |
| Storage2   | RG3            | Development Storage Account                         |

**Storage2** has its firewall enabled

---

### Answer:

-  You should create a private endpoint for Storage2 and connect it to the Sub2. 

The private endpoint uses a separate IP address from the Sub2 address space for the Storage2. 
As such, network traffic between the Docker containers running on VM2 and Storage2 traverses 
over Sub2 and private link using the Microsoft backbone network.

The following do not apply:

- You should not install the container network interface (CNI) plug-in. 

This plug-in is only allowed when using Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS).
[Kubernetes Network Plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/)
[Choose the best networking plugin for AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/choose-network-plugin-aks/)  

When you set up an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, it's important to consider the different options of 
network plugins for your business. Network plugins are required to configure network connectivity so applications
or pods in the cluster can communicate with each other.

- You should not create an application security group (ASG) and a network security group (NSG). 

An **ASG** is used to **group similar Azure VMs**, allowing you **to create security rules in an NSG** 
that references this application security group. 

This makes security rule management simpler as you can manage the NSG Rules of machine that run 
the same, similar or related apps as a signe group rather than down to the individual machines. 

However, you do not need an application security group to access a private service endpoint in the same subnet.

- You should not move Storage2 to RG2. 

Moving a storage account to another resource group within the same subscription does not affect network access
to a private service endpoint. VM2 can access Storage2, even if they are in different resource groups.

## Q004:

You need to determine which users can upload and download the 
container images stored in `Registry1`, based on the attached 
role for each user.

Which users should you choose? 

Upload images: User1 & User3 only
Download images: User1, User2 User3 only

---

### Answer:

Only User1 and User3 can upload images to Registry1. 

You need to use a role with the push image permission. 
The `Owner`, `Contributor`, and `AcrPush` Azure Container Registry roles have this permission. 
Only User1 and User3 have one of these roles.

User1, User2, and User3 are eligible to download images from Registry1. 

You need to use a role with the pull image permission. 
All Azure Container Registry roles, **except AcrDelete and AcrlmageSigner**, have this permission. 
The users who have one of these roles are User1, User2, and User3.

User4 has the `AcrlmageSigner` role, which does not have the permission to upload or download 
container images from Registry1.

These are the roles assigned to each user:

| User   | Role           |
|--------|----------------|
| User1  | Contributor    |
| User2  | AcrPull        |
| User3  | AcrPush        |
| User4  | AcrlmageSigner |

The following is information that is relevant to this particular question:

| Name       | Resource Group | Description                                          |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Registry1  | RG4            | Azure Container Registry for all images              |

| Name  | Set on | Lock type |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Lock4 | RG4    | Delete    |

| Policy                     | Resource type    | Scope |
|----------------------------|------------------|-------|
| Not allowed resource types | virtual Machines | RG4 |

## Q001-003:

Your organization has a subscription that hosts resources for 
multiple applications in Azure. 
The subscription is part of a tenant that has synchronization enabled 
using Microsoft Entra Connect with on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). 

The resources for each application are contained in individual resource groups.

As additional users are added to the application teams, 
you add roles for those users at the resource group level. 
Users can manage multiple applications.

You need to efficiently manage the permissions that are assigned 
to the Microsoft Entra users for them to access these resource groups.

Solution-1: 

You create Microsoft Entra groups for each application, 
add users to these groups, 
and assign roles to the groups at the resource group level.

Does the solution meet the goal?
---

### Answer: Yes

This solution meets the goal. 

Creating Microsoft Entra groups provides centralized user management of groups of users rather than individual users. 

When the group is provided permissions at the resource group level, all users in the group inherit the permissions provided to the group. 

To add or remove permissions for a given user, you would just add or remove them from the corresponding Microsoft Entra group. 

Roles are a collection of permissions, while groups are a collection of users. 
With groups, you are able to manage a collection of permissions 
for a collection of users, which eases the management of both 
the permissions and the users.

---

### References:

[Manage Microsoft Entra groups and group membership](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups)  

---


Solution-2: 

You create security groups in AD DS, 
add users to these groups, 
and assign roles to the groups at the resource group level.

Does the solution meet the goal?

### Answer: Yes

This solution meets the goal. 

Creating Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) security groups 
provides centralized user management of groups of users in your 
on-premises active directory. 

**Since these groups are synchronized with Microsoft Entra Connect**, 
they are available in Microsoft Entra to assign permissions. 

When the group is provided permissions at a resource group level, 
all users in the group inherit the permissions provided to the group. 

To add or remove permissions for a given user, you would just add or remove them from the corresponding AD DS group. Roles are a collection of permissions, while groups are a collection of users. With groups, you are able to manage a collection of permissions for a collection of users, which eases the management of both the permissions and the users.

[Microsoft Entra Connect Sync: Understanding Users, Groups, and Contacts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/concept-azure-ad-connect-sync-user-and-contacts)  


---

Solution-3: 
You remove permissions for the users at the resource group level and 
apply the same permissions for each individual user at the subscription level.

Does the solution meet the goal?

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal. 

You should not assign users permissions at the subscription level. 

Even though you can easily add and remove permissions to individual users, 
adding user permissions at the subscription level would provide them with 
permissions to all resource groups. 

The permissions need to be managed at the resource group level since each 
resource group contains the resources for a different application, and only
the users who manage a given application would need to have permission to 
those resources. 

Roles are a collection of permissions, while groups are a collection of users. 
With groups, you are able to manage a collection of permissions for a collection 
of users, which eases the management of both the permissions and the users.
