## Q050:

You plan to integrate your on-premises database server to Azure via an S2S VPN tunnel.
The on-premises VPN gateway supports specific IKE Phase 1 and IKE Phase 2 algorithms. You configured these parameters via the custom policy under the VPN gateway connection configuration. The VPN tunnel is still not able to get established between the Azure VPN gateway and the on-premises VPN device. You have already verified the IP information on the local VPN device, the VPN device IP/FQDN address on the Azure Local Network Gateway, and that the IKE Phase 1 and IKE Phase 2 information is configured correctly.
You need to identify the next troubleshooting steps to fix the issue.
Which three steps should you identify? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

Choose the correct answers

- Verify the Shared Key.
- Reset the VPN Gateway.
- Reset the VPN Connection.
- Change the Virtual Network Gateway SKU.
- Change the Virtual Network Gateway type.


---

### Answer:

- Verify the Shared Key.
- Reset the VPN Gateway.
- Reset the VPN Connection.

When you reset the Virtual Private Network (VPN) Gateway, it will help to reboot the Active instance of the gateway. If this does not work, you should then reset the VPN Gateway again. This time, it will reset the standby instance also and will failover to the active instance. Note that the Azure VPN Gateway uses two instances that run an Active/Standby mode. When you simply reset the VPN connection, the VPN tunnel is disconnected and the connection is re-established. The VPN gateway is not rebooted in this operation. Lastly, you must ensure that you use the same pre-shared key on both Azure VPN Gateway and the on- premises VPN device.
You should not change the Virtual Network Gateway type. The Virtual Network Gateway type option is used to define the role of the gateway. You can either define VPN or Express Route. As the type is already set to VPN, you do not need to modify it to Express Route.
You should not change the Virtual Network Gateway SKU. You can select different virtual network gateway SKUs depending on your requirements for the number of IPSec tunnels and the throughput. In the current scenario, the gateway SKU selection is fine as you are troubleshooting the problem with basic VPN connectivity.

## Q049:

You plan to integrate your local network resources to Azure via an S2S VPN tunnel. You have already configured the Virtual Network Gateway, the Local Network Gateway and the Gateway Subnet on the Azure portal.
You need to configure the on-site VPN device so the VPN connection can be established.
Which three configuration items should you use? To answer, move the appropriate configuration item from the list of Configuration entities to the answer area and arrange them in any order.

Create a list in any order

Configuration entities

Virtual Network Gateway
Local Network Gateway

Configuration required for on-site VPN

VPN shared key
Public IP address of the VPN Gateway
VPN device configuration script

---

### Answer:

You should use the following items to configure the on-site Virtual Private Network (VPN) device:

- VPN shared key
- Public IP address of the VPN Gateway
- VPN device configuration script

The VPN shared key is the same key that you configured on the Virtual Network Gateway. First, you must ensure the same shared key is configured on the on-site VPN device and the Azure Virtual Network Gateway or the connection will not establish. Then, you need to get the Azure Virtual Network Gateway Public IP and configure the same on the on-site VPN device for the remote gateway. Lastly, you will need to download the VPN device configuration script. Azure provides device specific configuration for different vendors, which you can use to configure the local VPN device.
You should not use Virtual Network Gateway. The Virtual Network Gateway entity is needed on the Azure portal to configure a virtual VPN gateway that connects to your local VPN device. The Virtual Network Gateway is created inside the Gateway Subnet and there you can define the VPN type, the Gateway type and VPN SKU you are planning to use.
You should not use the Local Network Gateway item. The Local Network Gateway is a representation of the on-premises network and defines the VPN device access IP or FQDN and the private address space you would like to route from Azure to the local VPN device.

## Q048:

An organization has connected its branch office via a site-to-site VPN connection to Azure VPN gateway.
They plan to change the branch office network address prefixes. They will also need to apply the prefix changes on Azure in order to use and access the Azure resource via the VPN tunnel and vice versa.
What should you configure in the Azure portal to meet the requirements?
Choose the correct answer

- GatewaySubnet
- Virtual Network Gateway
- Local Network Gateway
- Virtual Network

---

### Answer:
- Local Network Gateway

You should configure the Local Network Gateway in the Azure portal to update the new local network address prefix changes. The Local Network Gateway entity is used to configure the on-site VPN device public IP address and the local network prefix addresses. It is possible to edit the configuration after the entity is created.
You should not configure the Virtual Network Gateway in the Azure portal to update the new local network address prefix changes. The Virtual Network Gateway entity is the cloud VPN device in the Azure portal, which will establish the VPN tunnel with the on-premises VPN device.
You should not configure the Gateway Subnet in the Azure portal to update the new local network address prefix changes. The Gateway Subnet must be created for the VPN Gateway, and it contains the resources that will be used by the virtual network gateway resources and services.
You should not configure the Virtual Network in the Azure portal to update the new local network address prefix changes. The Azure virtual network provides the address space in a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block, which can be used to create different subnets.

## Q047:

Your company migrated its infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud six months ago when you deployed multiple network security services including segmenting the virtual network, deploying an Azure Firewall, and disabling insecure protocols to mitigate threats.
The Head of Cloud Security has recommended a review of network security within the Azure tenant via Defender for Cloud to increase the security posture of the environment. They have recommended you to complete the NS-2 security control: Secure cloud services with network controls.
You need to configure the Azure Service as per the Microsoft Guidance to complete this security control.
Which Azure Service should you configure within your tenant to meet this security control?

Choose the correct answer

- Network Security Groups (NSGS)
- DDoS Protection
- Application Security Groups (ASGS)
- Private Endpoints

---

### Answer:

- Private Endpoints

You should configure Private Endpoints on the Azure services that support this to meet the NS-2 security control. The Azure guidance in the Defender for Cloud portal for NS-2 recommends deploying private endpoints for all Azure resources that support the Private Link feature, to establish a private access point for the resources.
You should not configure DDoS Protection on the Azure services. Enabling DDoS protection on your virtual network is covered within NS-5 security control: Deploy DDOS protection. The Azure guidance in the Defender for Cloud portal for NS-5 is to enable DDoS Network Protection plan on your VNet to protect resources that are exposed to the public networks.
You should not configure either Network Security Groups (NSGs) or Application Security Groups (ASGs) on Azure services. The NSG is a network layer control to restrict or monitor traffic by port, protocol, source IP
address, or destination IP address whereas the ASG allows you to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure, allowing you to group virtual machines and define network security policies based on those groups. Both of these configurations fall under the NS-1: Establish network segmentation boundaries security control which has already been implemented when the company initially migrated to Azure.

## Q046:

Your company hosts its applications and infrastructure in Azure. There has been a recent attempt of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on your tenant, however the Firewall was able to prevent any major degradation in performance.
The Security Architect has created a new Azure DDoS protection plan named Ddos Protection PlanA to help mitigate this type of attack in the future and to ensure there is more defense against DDoS attacks. However, it is not enabled on the virtual network.
You need to use PowerShell to enable DDoS protection on the existing virtual network in your Azure tenant.
Which cmdlets should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options from the drop-down menus.

Choose the correct options

OPTIONS: 
Set-AzVirtualNetwork | Get-AzVirtualNetwork
New-AzDdosProtection | Get-AzDdosProtection

```
$ddosProtectionPlanID = OPTION-1 Plan -ResourceGroupName RG-A-Name Ddos ProtectionPlanA

$vnet = OPTION-2 -Name VNetA -ResourceGroupName RG-A

$vnet.DdosProtectionPlan New-Object Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Network.Models. PSResourceId

$vnet.DdosProtectionPlan. Id = $ddosProtectionPlanID. Id

$vnet.EnableDdosProtection = $true

$vnet | OPTION-3

```

```
$ddosProtectionPlanID = Get-AzDdosProtection Plan -ResourceGroupName RG-A-Name Ddos ProtectionPlanA

$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name VNetA -ResourceGroupName RG-A

$vnet.DdosProtectionPlan New-Object Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Network.Models. PSResourceId
$vnet.DdosProtectionPlan. Id = $ddosProtectionPlanID. Id
$vnet.EnableDdosProtection = $true
$vnet | Set-AzVirtualNetwork

```

---

### Answer:

You should complete the code as follows:

```
$ddosProtectionPlanID = Get-AzDdosProtectionPlan -ResourceGroupName RG-A-Name Ddos ProtectionPlanA
$vnet Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name VNetA -ResourceGroupName RG-A
$vnet. DdosProtection Plan = New-Object
Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Network.Models. PSResourceId
$vnet. Ddos ProtectionPlan. Id = $ddosProtectionPlanID.Id
$vnet.EnableDdosProtection $true
$vnet Set-AzVirtualNetwork
```

This PowerShell script will configure a new DDoS protection plan on an existing virtual network. You first need to use the Get-AzDdos Protection Plan. This will retrieve a DDosS Protection plan ID.
You then need to use the Get-AzVirtual Network cmdlet to retrieve up-to-date information on the existing virtual network in the resource group you specify.
Finally, you need to use the Set-AzVirtual Network to update the properties of the virtual network and complete the task of enabling the DDoS Protection plan within it.
You should not use the New-AzDdos Protection Plan, as this is used to create a new DDoS Protection plan. In the scenario, the Security Architect has already created the DDoS Protection plan, therefore you need to enable an existing one with the virtual network rather than create a new plan.

## Q045:

Your organization hosts its applications and infrastructure in Azure. They spread across multiple regions. including Italy North, West Europe, and UK South.
You have recently implemented a site-to-site VPN configuration between the UK South region and a new office that has opened in Manchester. During the initial testing, you were able to connect to virtual machines (VMs) hosted in the UK South region in your tenant from the Manchester office.
The Dev team has recently deployed a Linux server they are using to test a new application that they host on-premises, however they are unable to make a connection from the server. You are tasked with reviewing the configuration and troubleshoot the issue to find a resolution. You diagnose that a security rule on the NSG attached to the VM network card is the possible cause of the issue.
You need to use Network Watcher to confirm your diagnosis.

What feature should you use?

Choose the correct answer

- Next Hop
- IP Flow verify
- Packet Capture
- VPN Troubleshoot

---

### Answer:
- IP Flow verify

You should use the IP Flow verify to confirm your diagnosis. This feature allows you to diagnose connectivity issues from or to the internet and from or to the on-premises environment. An example of this is confirming if a security rule is blocking ingress or egress traffic to or from a virtual machine (VM) as in this scenario.
You should not use the Next Hop feature. This feature allows you to check if traffic is being directed to the intended destination by showing the next hop.
You should not use the Packet Capture feature. This feature enables you to create packet capture sessions to track traffic to and from a VM and helps to diagnose network anomalies both reactively and proactively. In this scenario, a NSG rule is causing the issue, therefore Packet Capture would not able to identify any NSG rule.
You should not use the VPN Troubleshoot feature. This feature allows you to troubleshoot gateways and connections to on-premises locations.

## Q044:

You plan to deploy an Azure virtual network for your company. You start designing the subnets by adding a load balancer.
You are tasked with adding a service that enables the company to connect its virtual machines through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) directly from the Azure site.
You need to find a solution to meet the requirements.

Which service should you use?
Choose the correct answer

- Azure Databricks
- Azure Front Door
- Azure Bastion
- RADIUS server

---

### Answer:
- Azure Bastion


You should use Azure Bastion. The Azure Bastion service is a fully managed PaaS service that you can deploy within your virtual network, It allows you to connect to your virtual machines through Remote Desktop Protocol/Secure Shell (RDP/SSH) over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) directly from the Azure site.
You should not use a RADIUS server. Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a network protocol that protects a network by allowing centralized dial-in user authentication and authorization.
You should not use Azure Front Door. This solution is used to elevate the global routing of your web, but cannot be used to connect virtual machines through RDP/SSH over SSL directly from the Azure site.
You should not use Azure Databricks. This service is a data analytics platform that contains applications related to Structured Query Language (SQL), data science, and machine learning. This solution cannot be used to connect virtual machines through RDP/SSH over SSL directly from the Azure site.

Your organization has an existing hub and spoke network topology deployed within its Azure environment, as shown in Exhibit A.
The company has decided to host a new enterprise application in Azure which requires a mesh network topology, as shown in Exhibit B. You use the connectivity configuration in Azure Virtual Network Manager to deploy the mesh network and manage the hub and spoke network moving forward.
You need to configure the virtual networks to allow them to communicate with each other.
Which connectivity construct should you use to configure communication between the virtual networks?

Choose the correct answer

- Connected Group
- Direct Connectivity
- Network Peering
- Site-to-Site VPN

---

### Answer:

- Connected Group

When you create a mesh network topology with Azure Virtual Network Manager, it creates a connectivity construct named Connected Groups. Virtual networks within a connected group are able to communicate with each other in the same way manually connected networks communicate with each other. Connected Groups do not have a peering configuration which is normally listed under 'Peerings' of the virtual network.
Virtual network peering allows you to connect two or more virtual networks together in Azure. Traffic in networks which are virtual peered uses the Microsoft backbone infrastructure. This is the connectivity construct used in Hub and Spoke network topologies, however this is not used with Mesh networks when configuring the topology via Azure Network Manager.
The VPN Gateway is an Azure service that is used to connect virtual networks hosts in Azure with networks hosted in on-premises locations like data centers. It allows you to send encrypted traffic between the Azure hosted virtual network and on-premises locations, however it is not used to connect/peer virtual networks to other virtual networks.
Direct connectivity is used within hub and spoke topology network configurations where an overlay of a connected group is created on top of your topology. It allows a spoke virtual network to communicate directly to other virtual networks in its group, but no virtual networks in other spokes.

## Q042:

Your company has an Azure tenant with one virtual network (VNet). You have deployed an Azure NAT gateway called NAT-01. An Azure virtual machine named VM-01 has been deployed to the VNet. An unused public IPv4 address with a standard SKU was also deployed to the subscription.
An external virtual machine named VM-02 is hosted by a third party and needs to communicate with VM-01.
You need to analyze the current configuration and confirm whether it is compatible with this requirement.
For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.

The existing public IP address can be assigned to NAT-01.
Yes

VM-02 can initiate a connection with VM-01.
No

VM-01 can send ICMP packets to VM-02.
No

---

### Answer:

The existing public IP address can be assigned to NAT-01. Public IP addresses with a Standard Stock- keeping Unit (SKU) or IP prefixes are compatible with an Azure Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway. Azure Virtual Network NAT ensures that virtual machines in an Azure virtual network (VNet) can communicate to external services using the NAT gateway's public IP address. This saves administrators assigning the virtual machines a public IP address, which would increase the security threats in an environment. IP addresses with a basic SKU cannot be configured with NAT gateway.
The external VM cannot initiate a connection with VM-01. With an Azure NAT gateway, the traffic must originate from VM-01. VM-02 does not have the ability to initiate a connection with VM-01. It can only communicate back to VM-01 via a NAT gateway, if it is already engaged in an active flow.
VM-01 cannot send ICMP packets to VM-02. Only TCP and UDP network packets can be transferred across a NAT gateway. For example, if an Azure virtual machine needs to contact an external API on port 80 (HTTP), Azure NAT can be used to support this scenario. ICMP is not a supported protocol.

## Q041:

Your company has an Azure tenant with one virtual network (VNet). A production virtual machine has been configured in one of the subnets.
You need to configure outbound IP connectivity from the virtual machine to an external HTTP API. The solution must minimize costs.

What solution should you recommend?

Choose the correct answer

- Deploy an internal Azure load balancer to the virtual network (VNet).
- Configure Azure Private Link.
- Configure Azure Virtual Network Address Translation (NAT).
- Configure Azure Firewall.


---

### Answer:
- Configure Azure Virtual Network Address Translation (NAT).

You should configure Azure Virtual NAT. A NAT gateway can be used to forward traffic from private Azure resources to external services. This can be done by linking the NAT gateway to subnets. When NAT is configured, it uses Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) to translate private IP addresses in an Azure network to a static public IP Address. This allows private IP addresses to communicate with public hosts using the internet. When Azure Virtual NAT has been deployed and configured, outbound connectivity is automatically managed, without the need for additional configuration or user defined routes (UDR). This would be the recommended solution as it minimizes costs and would fulfill the requirement.
You should not configure Azure Firewall. Azure Firewall is a fully stateful Firewall as a Service (FWaaS) and provides SNAT automatically for all outbound connectivity. SNAT essentially translates all outbound network traffic to the Azure Firewall public IP address. However, this would not meet the requirement as it is not the most cost-effective solution. Azure Firewall is costly in comparison to the other answer choices provided.
You should not configure Azure Private Link. Private links are commonly used to protect access to Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) services. For example, if you created a storage account that can only be accessed from an on-premises network, then you would utilize Azure Private Link.
You should not deploy an internal Azure Load Balancer to the virtual network (VNet). Azure Load Balancers operate at layer 4 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. An internal Azure load balancer is used to distribute traffic to a group of Azure resources or servers. An internal load balancer will only distribute traffic to resources in the Azure VNet and will not allow external outbound connectivity.

## Q040:

You are an Azure administrator for an insurance company. You have successfully established a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN tunnel from the on-premises network to Azure. The on-premises network address space is 10.0.0.0/24. In Azure, there is one virtual network (VNet) with three subnets named Gateway Subnet, application, and database.
You need to force internet-bound traffic from the database subnet back to on-premises for auditing and inspection.

What should you do?

Choose the correct answer

- Create a route table, add a user-defined route for 0.0.0.0/0 with the next hop type as None, and associate the route table to the database subnet.

- Create a route table, add a user-defined route for 10.0.0.0/24 with the next hop type as Virtual network gateway, and associate the route table to the database subnet.

- Create a route table, add a user-defined route for 0.0.0.0/0 with the next hop type as Internet, and associate the route table to the GatewaySubnet.

- Create a route table, add a user-defined route for 0.0.0.0/0 with next hop type as Virtual network gateway, and associate the route table to the database subnet.

---

### Answer:

- Create a route table, add a user-defined route for 0.0.0.0/0 with next hop type as Virtual network gateway, and associate the route table to the database subnet.


You should create a route table, add a user defined route for 0.0.0.0/0 with the next hop type as Virtual network gateway, and associate the route table to the database subnet. The address prefix 0.0.0.0/0 will direct all traffic. The requirement states that all internet-bound traffic needs to traverse from the on-premises network first. Choosing the next hop type as virtual network gateway will force traffic to the VPN gateway and back to on-premises. The traffic that requires redirection is based in the database subnet, and thus the route should be associated in this subnet only.
You should not create a route table, add a user defined route for 10.0.0.0/24 with the next hop type as Virtual network gateway, and associate the route table to the database subnet. The address space 10.0.0.0/24 refers to the on-premises network. This will not encapsulate internet-bound traffic.
You should not create a route table, add a user defined route for 0.0.0.0/0 with the next hop type as
Internet, and associate the route table to the Gateway Subnet. If the routing rule is associated to the
Gateway Subnet it will not be able to redirect traffic from the database subnet, which is the key requirement
highlighted in the scenario.
You should not create a route table, add a user defined route for 0.0.0.0/0 with the next hop type as None,
and associate the route table to the database subnet. Choosing the next hop type as None will essentially
drop all the network traffic in this instance. This is the opposite of what needs to be achieved.

## Q039:

![image info](./Q39_1.PNG)


Your organization recently acquired two new companies: Skrul Tech and Jinsey Electrics. As part of the merge, you were asked to connect the two virtual networks (VNets) to the parent hub VNet.
Please refer to the exhibit for the current Azure VNet configuration. Jinsey Electrics employees now need to connect to resources located on-premises but are unable to do so.
You need to allow Jinsey Electrics employees to connect to on-premises resources. The solution must be cost-effective. Which solution should you provide?
Choose the correct answer
Deploy a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) in the Hub VNet and configure User-Defined Routes (UDR).
Deploy an Azure Firewall in the Hub VNet and configure User-Defined Routes (UDR).
Configure a User-Defined Route (UDR) from the Jinsey Electrics subnet to route traffic to the on-premises network.
Enable Use the remote virtual network's gateway property on the VNet peering connection.

---

### Answer:

You should enable Use the remote virtual network's gateway property on the VNet peering connection. The exhibit currently shows VNet peering as configured from both spoke VNets to the hub VNet. The reason why Jinsey Electrics employees cannot access on-premises resources is that traffic is currently prohibited along this route. Modifying the VNet peering and utilizing the remote virtual network gateway allows traffic to traverse via the VPN gateway to on-premises.
You should not deploy an Azure Firewall in the Hub VNet and configure UDR. Azure Firewall can technically be deployed in the Hub VNet and it can be used to route traffic back to the on-premises network. This does not meet the requirement of being cost-effective. Azure Firewall will impose additional monthly costs.
You should not deploy a NVA in the Hub VNet and configure User Defined Routes. This option is an alternative to using Azure Firewall. While it is technically possible to route traffic from the spoke VNets back to on-premises via an NVA, it does not meet the cost-effectiveness requirement.
You should not configure a UDR from the Jinsey Electrics subnet to route traffic to on-premises. The current
deployment highlighted in the exhibit will not allow traffic to traverse via the VPN gateway to the 
on-premises network. The VNet peering connection from the spoke needs to be modified to use the remote virtual network gateway.

## Q038:

You plan to configure your VNET for the middle tier of the web application that is not reachable from the public internet.
You need to configure a private address space for the middle tier VNET.
Which three private RFC 1918 IP address ranges should you use? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

Choose the correct answers

172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16
10.0.0.0/8
172.15.0.0/24
192.167.0.0/24
224.0.0.0/4

---

### Answer:

172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16
10.0.0.0/8

You should use the following private RFC 1918 IP address ranges for the configuration of your VNET Address space:

10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16

As a best practice, Azure virtual resources (for example, virtual machines) should always be configured in an RFC 1918 private IP subnet. The IP address assignment will be controlled by Azure DHCP, which will lease the IPs as per the assigned subnet. The private IP address space is non-routable and cannot be used on the public internet.

You should not use the following:

192.167.0.0/24
172.15.0.0/24

These do not cover the complete range of the private RFC 1918 IP address space and just denote the public internet subnet range.
You should not use the 224.0.0.0/4 address range. It denotes the CIDR notation for the multicast address group. The complete range of addresses covered by this block is 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. Multicast addresses are used to send traffic to a group of devices, for example, a group of nodes that will listen to the multicast address. You should not use this address space as it does not cover the RFC 1918 IP address space required.

## Q037:

![image info](./Q37_1.PNG)

Your company has the Azure virtual network (VNet) shown in the Network Architecture exhibit.
Your manager wants to share a single IPv4 address with two VMs located at a subnet level.
You need to implement a solution that meets the requirement.

What solution should you use?
Choose the correct answer

- Azure Bastion
- Application Proxy
- ExpressRoute Direct
- A NAT gateway

---

### Answer:
- A NAT gateway

You should use a NAT gateway to share a single IPv4 address with two VMs located at a subnet level. A Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway is a solution provided by Azure that enables you to establish an outbound connection to the internet on a subnet level where you can attach the two VMs to a single IPv4 address. A NAT gateway can also be used to map a range of IP addresses, defined by an IP prefix, to internal resources.
You should not use Express Route Direct. Express Route Direct is used to connect you directly to the global network of Microsoft, but cannot be used to share a single IPv4 address with two VMs located at a subnet level.
You should not create an Application Proxy. This solution can be used to publish on-premises applications to networks outside the company.
You should not use Azure Bastion. The Azure Bastion service is a fully managed PaaS service that you can deploy within your virtual network. It allows you to connect to your virtual machines through Remote Desktop Protocol/Secure Shell (RDP/SSH) over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) directly from the Azure site.

## Q036:

You have an Azure virtual network (VNet) that includes three separate subnets named SubnetA, SubnetB, and SubnetC. The subnets are configured as follows:
SubnetA contains a webserver.
SubnetB contains an API server.
SubnetC contains a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA).
You need to redirect the traffic from the webserver to a NVA and then to the API server.
What solution should you use?

Choose the correct answer

- Standard Load Balancer
- User-defined route
- Network security group (NSG)
- Application Gateway

---

### Answer:
- User-defined route

You should use a user-defined route (UDR) to direct the traffic from the webserver to a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) and then to the API server. UDR is an Azure service that enables you to create and control network routes where your NVA can manage the traffic between separate subnets and direct them to the internet. When the traffic routes from the webserver to the NVA, through UDR, the firewall within the NVA will determine whether this traffic should be allowed or denied from being routed to the Application Programming Interface (API) server.
You should not use a network security group (NSG). A NSG is an Azure service that enables you to secure the premises of your network against threats. This inspects traffic and has the ability to allow or deny traffic from accessing a network packet.
You should not use a Standard Load Balancer. A Standard Load Balancer enables you to load balance protocol flows on all ports when using an internal load balancer through High Availability ports, but cannot be used to direct traffic.
You should not use Application Gateway. An application gateway is a load-balancing solution that is used to
load balance between servers at an application level. Application Gateway operates at layer 7 of the OSI model. The usage of an application gateway is beneficial in case you need to protect and secure the traffic sent and received by your app.

## Q035:

You plan to deploy a distributed application on Azure and some services require delegation to dedicated subnets.
You need to identify which Azure Network services must be deployed in their own dedicated subnet.

Which two services should you identify? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

Choose the correct answers

- Application Gateway - Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Azure Firewall
- Virtual machine scale sets
- Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS)
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

---

### Answer:

- Application Gateway - Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Azure Firewall

You should identify Application Gateway - Web Application Firewall (WAF). The Azure Application Gateway is a layer 7 load balancer that you can use to manage the incoming traffic to your web applications. You need a dedicated subnet to deploy an Application Gateway WAF. WAF is a component of the Application Gateway that can be used to add a security layer to filter web traffic. You can configure different custom rules and can use Azure managed rules under WAF policies to protect your infrastructure. WAF can also provide protection against all the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 vulnerabilities and supports Core Rule Set (CRS) 3.1, 3.0, or 2.2.9.
You should also identify Azure Firewall. Azure Firewall is a fully-managed cloud firewall solution that you can use to configure L3-L7 security policies. Azure Firewall will have its own public IP and all the internal virtual instances will talk to the external network via the firewall. You must assign a dedicated subnet to the firewall and then use User Defined Routes (UDP) to route the traffic from the internal virtual resources to Azure Firewall using the Next hop type as Virtual appliance.
You should not identify Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). Azure AD DS can be deployed in a shared subnet with other resources. It provides an option to end users to configure their authentication
domains on the Azure cloud in order to move their legacy applications to Azure that cannot use modern authentication methods. Note that for Azure Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) deployment, a dedicated subnet will be required.

You should not identify Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). AKS can be deployed in a shared subnet with other resources. Kubernetes can be used for the orchestration and management of the containers.
You should not identify virtual machine scale sets. Azure virtual machine scale sets can be deployed in a shared subnet with other resources. Virtual machine scale sets can be used to create a highly available application by creating a group of virtual machine instances that will scale up and down as per the incoming traffic.

## Q034:

You plan to configure a route table for CompanyA's core subnet. The table contains the user-defined routes (UDR) to override the Azure default system route table.

The required route table entries will be:

- The BLOCK_SUB route entry is used to block the traffic for destination prefix 192.168.0.0/16.

- The VNET_SUB route entry is used to send the destination prefix 10.7.0.0/24 traffic to the internal private network.

- the VNET_SUB2 route entry is used to send the destination prefix 10.8.0.0/24 traffic to the internal private network.

- The INT_0000 route entry is used to send all remaining traffic to the internet.

You need to complete the table with the correct destination prefix and next-hop address type.
How should you complete the table? To answer, select the appropriate options from the drop-down menus.

Choose the correct options:

OPTION-1: 0.0.0.0/0 | 0.0.0.0/32

OPTION-2: None | Internet | VirtualNetwork


| Name       | Address prefix | Next hop type | Next hop IP address |
|------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| BLOCK_SUB  | 192.168.0.0/16 | OPTION-2        | -                  |
| INT_0000   | OPTION-1      | OPTION-2     | -                  |
| VNET_SUB   | 10.7.0.0/24     | OPTION-2 | -                  |
| VNET_SUB2  | 10.8.0.0/24     | OPTION-2 | -                  |

| Name     | Address range | Virtual network | Security group |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| default  | 10.7.0.0/24   | VNET-1         | -              |
| default  | 10.8.0.0/24   | VNET-2         | -              |


> Table with the right selections;

| Name       | Address prefix | Next hop type | Next hop IP address |
|------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| BLOCK_SUB  | 192.168.0.0/16 | None        | -                  |
| INT_0000   | 0.0.0.0/0      | Internet     | -                  |
| VNET_SUB   | 10.7.0.0/24     | Virtual network | -                  |
| VNET_SUB2  | 10.8.0.0/24     | Virtual network | -                  |

| Name     | Address range | Virtual network | Security group |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| default  | 10.7.0.0/24   | VNET-1         | -              |
| default  | 10.8.0.0/24   | VNET-2         | -              |


---

### Answer:

| Name       | Address prefix | Next hop type |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| BLOCK_SUB  | 192.168.0.0/16 | None        |
| INT_0000   | 0.0.0.0/0      | Internet     |
| VNET_SUB   | 10.7.0.0/24     | Virtual network |
| VNET_SUB2  | 10.8.0.0/24     | Virtual network |

The BLOCK_SUB route is sending all the traffic for destination prefix 192.168.0.0/16 to a None next-hop type. The None next-hop type is used to configure a sinkhole for an IP address or destination prefix. All of the traffic for this destination prefix will be dropped. The Internet next-hop type is used to send traffic to the public internet while the Virtual Network next-hop type is used to route traffic to the corresponding virtual network (VNet) subnet.
The INT-0000 route is used to send all the destination prefix 0.0.0.0/0 traffic to the next-hop type Internet. You should not use 0.0.0.0/32 for the INT_0000 route; it is an incorrect prefix to configure a default route towards the public internet. Moreover, for the public internet-bound traffic, the next-hop type should be always set to Internet.
The VNET_SUB route is used to send all the destination prefix 10.7.0.0/24 traffic towards the internal virtual network (VNet). You should not use the next-hop address of Internet or None here. The Internet next-hop type is used to send traffic to the public Internet while the None next-hope type is used to drop the traffic
The VNET_SUB2 route is used to send all the destination prefix 10.8.0.0/24 traffic towards the internal VNet. You should not set the next-hop address to Internet or None here. The Internet next-hop type is used to send traffic to the public Internet while the None next-hope type is used to drop the traffic.

## Q033:

You plan to use Azure NAT Gateway to provide a consistent public IP address space to internal Azure resources.
The NAT Gateway needs to be configured with a Public IP address and a subnet.
What is the maximum number of Public IP addresses that you can assign to Azure NAT Gateway?

Choose the correct answer

- 16
- 12
- 2
- 1

---

### Answer:
16 

You can assign a maximum of 16 Public IP addresses to Azure NAT Gateway. Azure NAT Gateway provides an option to Azure internal resources with private IP addresses to access the internet. NAT Gateway can also be used to hide the internal network topology, which helps to protect the internal virtual resources from the attacks originating from the public internet. You can also assign a Public IP prefix to the NAT gateway; all the IPs from the prefix will be used by the gateway for the outbound internet connection. NAT Gateway uses a mechanism called Port Address Translation (PAT) to translate the internal private IP address and port to the outbound Public IP address and port number.

## Q032:

You plan to configure your application on Azure, but you want to hide the internal network. You decide to use Azure NAT Gateway.
For better performance of the application, you decide to assign a public IP address prefix to cover six public IP addresses. You name the public IP prefix PUBLIC_NAT_PREFIX.

Which of the following public IP prefixes should you choose?

Choose the correct answer

/31
/29
/28
/30

---

### Answer:
/29

You should use the /29 prefix for the six public IPv4 addresses. A /29 prefix will give you a total of eight IP addresses from which you can use six IP addresses for your public IP addressing need. You can either configure a single IPv4 public IP address or a complete IPv4 network prefix (which will comprise a set of IPv4 addresses) and then bind it to the Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway. The following public IP prefix sizes are available:

/28 (IPv4) or /124 (IPv6) = Total 16 addresses
/29 (IPv4) or /125 (IPv6) = Total 8 addresses
/30 (IPv4) or /126 (IPv6) = Total 4 addresses
/31 (IPv4) or /127 (IPv6) = Total 2 addresses

NAT functionality provides an option for Azure resources to communicate with the public internet without exposing their internal IP addresses. This provides an additional layer of security. Public internet users only see the NAT Gateway IP(s) and are not capable of retrieving any information regarding the internal network.

## Q031:

Your company has two Azure virtual networks (VNets), named VNET-1 and VNET-2. A Windows10 virtual machine (VM) is configured in each VNet, as shown in the exhibit. The Windows10 machine in VNET-1 can RDP the Windows10 machine in VNET-2 using its public IP address. However, the Windows10 machine in VNET-1 cannot RDP to the Windows 10 machine in VNET-2 using its private IP address.
You need to enable the VM in VNET-1 to access the VM in VNET-2, so they can access each other using Azure private subnet IPs.
What solution should you configure?
Choose the correct answer
Private endpoints
VNet peering
Network security groups (NSGs)
Service endpoints

---

### Answer:

You should configure virtual network (VNet) peering to allow VNET-1 to VNET-2 private connectivity. In a VNet peering set-up, the traffic flows via the Microsoft backbone private network instead of using the public internet.
You should not configure Azure private endpoints. Azure private endpoints can be used to connect to Azure services via a private IP interface. The private endpoints cannot be used to peer two VNets. The virtual machine connects through a private endpoint to a private link resource, which can be any Azure resource, like, for example, Cosmos DB, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and Azure Service Bus.
You should not configure Azure service endpoints. Azure Service endpoints are used to connect to Azure services via an optimized path. The service endpoints cannot be used to peer two VNets. The virtual machine will use the public IP of the Azure service to communicate to it and the service will see only the private IP of the virtual machine. The virtual machines or resources do not need a public IP address to communicate with Azure services via a service endpoint.

You should not configure network security groups (NSGs). NSGs are used to secure the virtual resources on Azure. NSGs are not used to peer two VNets. Instead, they are used to protect Azure resources by configuring inbound and outbound rules to filter the traffic. The NSG is a stateful firewall; any outbound connection by default allows the reverse traffic for that connection flow.

## Q029:

You work at a company that has an Azure subscription. You create a DNS zone so that your company can host its DNS domain within Azure DNS.
You retrieve the name servers of your created DNS zone.
You need to delegate the DNS domain.
For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.


You should use the Azure name servers to substitute the Name Server (NS) records.
Yes

You should query the Start of Authority (SOA) record using the nslookup tool.
No

You should establish a test virtual machine.
No

---

### Answer:

You should use the Azure name servers to substitute the NS records to delegate the DNS domain. Delegating your domain is a required action to do so that you can host your Domain Name System (DNS) domain within Azure DNS. DNS zones are used by companies to host records of their companies' domain names.
You should not query the SOA record using the nslookup tool. This is done to verify whether the delegation to your domain is successfully done. You can use the nslookup command within the command prompt so that you can query the SOA record for the DNS zone you have created.
You should not establish a test virtual machine. This action will not allow you to delegate your DNS domain but would enable you to test if your private DNS zone is working properly.

## Q028:

You plan to configure a 10.1.0.0/24 subnet under your VNet, which is configured with an address space of 10.1.0.0/16 for your web application.
You should only use non-reserved IP addresses in your solution so it does not conflict with Azure resources.

You need to identify which addresses from this subnet are reserved and cannot be used.
Which three addresses should you identify? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

Choose the correct answers

- 10.1.0.230
- 10.1.0.0
- 10.1.0.255
- 10.1.0.1 
- 10.1.0.251

---

### Answer:

- 10.1.0.0
- 10.1.0.255
- 10.1.0.1 


The following addresses will be reserved from the subnet (10.1.0.0/24):

- 10.1.0.0 Network Address
- 10.1.0.1 Default Gateway Address
- 10.1.0.255 Broadcast Address

These addresses will not be allocated by Azure Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) to any Azure virtual machine. By default, Azure will reserve five addresses from each subnet.

A few other addresses that will be reserved from a subnet are: x.x.x.2, x.x.x.3: Reserved by Azure to map the Azure DNS IPs to the virtual network (VNet) space.

The following are valid addresses and can be assigned to Azure virtual resources:

- 10.1.0.251
- 10.1.0.230

## Q027:

You plan to configure two Azure virtual networks: VNet1 and Vnet2.

| Vnet | Address space | Subnet assigned |
|---|---|---|
| VNet1 | 10.1.0.0/16 | 10.1.1.0/24 |
| VNet2 | 10.1.0.0/16 | 10.1.2.0/24 |


VNet1 is the Front web tier and will receive the incoming connections from the internet. It has virtual machine VM1 configured as a web server.
VNet2 is the Backend tier and will receive all the database connections from the front end web server. It has virtual machine VM2 configured as a database server.

The following table shows the virtual machine details and their corresponding private IP addresses:


| Virtual machine | Function | IP Address |
|---|---|---|
| VM1 | Web Server | 10.1.1.10 |
| VM2 | Database Server | 10.1.2.10 |

Network security groups (NSGs) in each virtual network are configured with the default RDP (3389) rule and
assigned to each virtual machine network interface.
For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.


You can configure virtual network peering between VNet1 and VNet2.
No

Virtual machines in VNet1 are able to ping virtual machines in VNet2.
No

On initial creation, the subnet in VNet1 will be assigned the Default (Azure-provided) DNS servers.
Yes

---

### Answer:

You cannot configure virtual network peering between VNet1 and VNet2. You cannot configure virtual network peering for overlapping Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks. In this scenario, both VNet1 and VNet2 have an address space of 10.1.0.0/16. Therefore, they cannot peer with each other.
Virtual machines in VNet1 are not able to ping virtual machines in VNet2. Both virtual networks are isolated, and therefore the resources inside these networks are not able to communicate with each other.
On initial creation, the subnet in VNet1 will be assigned the Default (Azure-provided) DNS servers. When you create a subnet, Azure will assign a default DNS server to it. These default DNS servers can be changed with custom DNS servers later on.

## Q026:

You plan to migrate your organization domain name companyA.com from a third party domain registrar to Azure.
You must create the parent domain name entry on the Azure portal under the Domain Name System (DNS) zones named companyA.com.
What further action should you take to complete the domain name migration?

Choose the correct answer

- Update the Start of Authority (SOA) record for the parent domain name under Azure DNS zone with the third party domain registrar SOA details.

- Update the SOA record for the third party domain registrar with Azure DNS zone Start of Authority (SOA record) for the parent record.

- Update the parent domain registrar DNS name servers under the Azure DNS zone.

- Update the parent domain registrar DNS settings with the Azure DNS name servers.

---

### Answer:
- Update the parent domain registrar DNS settings with the Azure DNS name servers.

You should update the parent domain registrar Domain Name System (DNS) settings with the Azure DNS name servers. When you create the parent domain name entry under the Azure DNS zone, the following four Name Servers (NS) are assigned by default to the zone:

- Name server 1 ns1-35.azure-dns.com.
- Name server 2 ns2-35.azure-dns.net.
- Name server 3 ns3-35.azure-dns.org.
- Name server 4 ns4-35.azure-dns.info.

You will need to copy these four NS records to the third party registrar to complete the domain name migration to the Azure DNS zone. NS records are used to configure the authoritative DNS server detail that contains the actual domain information. You will always see these NS servers in Azure Public DNS zones and they cannot be deleted or edited. Should you like, additional name servers can be added.
You should not update the parent domain registrar DNS name servers under the Azure DNS zone. The domain is supposed to be delegated to the Azure DNS; therefore, there is no need to perform this configuration.
You should not update the Start of Authority (SOA) record for the third party domain registrar with Azure DNS zone SOA record for the parent record. This step is not required and you are not advised to modify the SOA information under the DNS settings.
You should not update the SOA record for the parent domain name under Azure DNS zone with the third party domain registrar SOA details. This step is not required. The SOA record is automatically populated by Azure when the parent domain zone is created. The SOA record defines the main NS for the domain name.

## Q023-Q025:

You are one of four Azure administrators in your organization. You have deployed a web app in West Europe and configured it as a backend pool in Azure Front Door. Your co-workers have created a Web Application Firewall (WAF) policy and applied it to Azure Front Door. The rules engine has also been modified.
Users of the web app have recently complained that they are being presented with the following error message: "The request is blocked".

You need to promptly resolve this issue. The solution must not compromise security.

---

## Q025:

Solution: Remove the WAF policy from Azure Front Door.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. You should not remove the WAF policy from Azure Front Door. Removing the WAF policy will restore traffic flow, but doing so will go against the compromising security requirement, as the web app will be exposed to security threats.

[Policy settings for Web Application Firewall on Azure Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/web-application-firewall/afds/waf-front-door-policy-settings)  

---

## Q024:

Solution: Verify that there are no conflicting rules in the WAF policy associated with Azure Front Door.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. You should verify that there are no conflicting rules in the WAF policy associated with Azure Front Door. Custom WAF rules take priority over Microsoft managed rules. Administrators can block incoming traffic to Azure Front Door using custom rules, based on conditions such as geolocation and IP address. If a blocked error message is presented, then it will be related to an Azure Front Door WAF policy.

## Q023:

Solution: Verify that there are no conflicting rules in rules engine for Azure Front Door.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. You should not verify that there are no conflicting rules in the rules engine for Azure Front Door. Rules engine can be used to provide a more granular control on how HTTP traffic is handled by Azure Front Door. For example, if a user is browsing on a mobile device, then a rule can be configured to re-direct users to a mobile friendly site. Rules engine will not, however, present users with blocked messages.

## Q020-Q022:

You are an Azure network administrator for a transport company. Azure Firewall has been deployed to filter traffic in a hub and spoke topology. The Azure Firewall rules are currently empty and require configuration.
Your colleague has requested external network connectivity for one of the application servers, which is in one of the spoke virtual networks (VNets).
You need to allow the application server to connect to www.company1.com using Azure Firewall and custom Domain Name System (DNS) servers.

---

## Q022:

Solution: create a DNAT (Destination Network Address Translation) rule collection AND THEN CREATE A dnat RULE.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT) rules allow users to connect to private IP addresses behind Azure Firewall via the public interface (IP address). A common scenario for this type of rule is for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections to an Azure virtual machine from the internet. For instance, a business need could surface that requires a third party support provider to connect to one of your Azure virtual machines over the internet using RDP. This would be needed so that the third party support provider could efficiently support the application that is running on the virtual machine and to hit any agreed Service Level Agreements (SLAs). All the third party would require is the public IP address in order to connect via RDP to the virtual machine from their headquarters.

## Q021:

Solution: Add an application and network rule collection, and then create an application network rule.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. An application rule alone will not meet the requirement of the request. DNS connectivity on port 53 is also required, which must be configured as a network rule. As a result, you need to configure both an application and a network rule. During the network rule creation, you must map port 53 to the custom DNS servers.

## Q020:

Solution: Create an application rule collection, and then create an application rule.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. An application rule is based on Layer 7 of the Network OSI model. This will allow administrators to add a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the rule. For connectivity to www.company1.com to work, DNS on port 53 is also required, in the form of a network rule.

## Q017-Q019:

You work as an Azure administrator for a clothing company. You have two virtual machines configured with the below network settings. Network Security Groups (NSGs) have been assigned to the individual virtual machine Network Interface Cards (NICs) with the default rules.

| VM Name | VNET | Subnet | NSG |
|---|---|---|---|
| VM01 | VNET1 | SN1 | NSG1 |
| VM02 | VNET1 | SN2 | NSG2 |

Your colleague needs to connect to VMO2 from VM01 using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to test an application. You need to ensure that RDP access from VM01 to VMO2 will work.
The solution must not include any unnecessary administrative effort.

## Q019:

Solution: Do Nothing.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes


This solution meets the goal. You should do nothing. The Remote Desktop Protocol allows remote users to connect to another Microsoft Windows machine from another location. This can either be over the public internet or a local network. The AllowVNetInbound rule allows any traffic between virtual networks by default. This includes RDP connectivity between virtual machines.

---

### References

---

## Q018:

Solution: Create an inbound rule for port 3389 on NSG1 and NSG1.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. You should not create inbound and outgoing rules for port 3389 on both NSG1 and NSG2. The Remote Desktop Protocol allows remote users to connect to another Microsoft Windows machine from another location. This can either be over the public internet or a local network. NSGs consist of a rule labelled AllowVNetInBound. This rule allows all hosts inside the virtual network (including subnets) to communicate with each other.

---

## Q017:


Solution: Create an inbound rule for port 3389 on NSG2.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. You should not create an inbound rule for port 3389 on NSG2. The Remote Desktop Protocol allows remote users to connect to another Microsoft Windows machine from another location. This can either be over the public internet or a local network. An additional rule to explicitly allow RDP traffic is not required. This is due to the default Network Security Group (NSG) rules already permitting any traffic between virtual networks and virtual machines.

---

## Q014-Q016:

You work as an Azure administrator for a logistics company. You have an Azure subscription with the following resources:

| Resource Type | Resource Name | Azure Region |
|---|---|---|
| Virtual Network | Vnet1 | UK South |
| Virtual Machine | Vm1 | UK South |
| Storage Account | Storage1 | UK South |
| Storage Account | Storage2 | UK South |

You need to meet the following requirements:

- Vm1 needs to securely connect to Storage1 over the Azure backbone network.
- Resources in Vnet1 can only connect to Storage1 and no other storage accounts.

---

## Q016:


Solution: You deploy Azure Front Door and create a custom rules engine rule.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. You should not deploy Azure Front Door and create a custom rules engine rule. Azure Front Door is a global Layer 7 load-balancing service. Layer 7 refers to the Application layer of the Open Systems Interconnect model (OSI model). This can be useful if you have a number of virtual machines in different regions. Azure Front Door can be used to direct traffic (load balance) to the most appropriate virtual machine based on the source region of the end user. This ensures that the end user is always connecting to the closest virtual machine. Azure Front Door can be further customized by adding custom rules using the rules engine. This would not apply in this scenario as Azure Front Door is a service that is accessible from the internet. A rules engine rule can be used to redirect users to a mobile friendly website if the source device is a mobile.

## Q015:

Solution: You deploy a service endpoint and service endpoint policy.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. You should deploy a service endpoint and service endpoint policy. A service endpoint allows you to directly connect a subnet to a public Azure service such as storage accounts. This means that the virtual machine does not require an outbound connection to the internet, which is often a security concern. The relevant virtual network and subnet can then be associated to the storage account under the networking blade. This ensures that the first requirement is met, as Vm1 securely connects to the storage account over the Azure backbone network without making outgoing public calls via the internet. The secondary requirement is met by creating a service endpoint policy. If you create a service endpoint policy you can ensure that data exfiltration is not possible. For instance, during the service endpoint policy creation, you would need to ensure that you explicitly state that only Storage1 is accessible over the service endpoint. Access to other storage accounts will be denied from the subnet.

---

## Q014:

Solution: You deploy a private endpoint and Private Link service.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. You should not deploy a private endpoint and Private Link service. A private endpoint allows you to completely isolate an Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) service, such as a web app, so that it can only be contacted by an internal Azure resource. A private endpoint also allows traffic from on-premises networks to securely connect to the resource without traversing via the internet. This answer is not applicable for this scenario as the requirement does not state that private access from an on-premises network or virtual network is necessary. The scenario states that Vm1 needs to connect to Storage1 over the Azure backbone network only. For this reason, a private endpoint and private link service is an incorrect solution.

## Q010-013:

You are the Azure administrator in your organization. A virtual network (VNet) with three subnets has been deployed with three virtual machines. A Site-to-Site VPN tunnel was also configured to connect Azure to the on-premises data center.
You have received reports of latency issues between on-premises clients and the Azure virtual machines. You run Network Watcher VPN diagnostics.

You need to analyze the ingress and egress bytes for the VPN connection.

---

## Q013:

Solution: You configure and analyze Network Security Group Flow Logs.
Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. You should not configure and analyze Network Security Group (NSG) Flow Logs. Network Security Group flow logs is an optional feature that comes bundled with Network Watcher. These logs will allow you to analyze network traffic that passes through a Network Security Group. This diagnostic test does not apply to the requirement as it specifically requests ingress and egress bytes for the VPN tunnel. This specifically relates to all data that passes through a given Network Security Group. Analyzing the ingress and egress data can be useful to verify whether data is actually reaching the Network Security Group in the first place.

## Q010:

Solution: From Network Watcher, inspect the IKEErrors.txt file.
Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. From Network Watcher, you should not inspect the 'IKEErrors.txt' file. This file will only report issues and errors relating to the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) component of the VPN tunnel. The IKE process allows VPN peers at both ends to successfully encrypt and decrypt network packets traveling over the VPN tunnel, using a mutually agreed pre-shared key or certificate. This process consists of two phases: phase 1 and phase 2. Each phase uses encryption algorithms and keys. The IKEErrors.txt file will list any issues encountered during either phase initiation.

## Q009:

Solution: re-download the VPN client configuration fpr the North US Windows user and the North US IOS user.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Downloading the VPN client configuration for users should only be done if the topology of a network is modified so that the changes of the topology can be implemented again to the client.

---

## Q008:

Solution: You use BGP on the gateway of VnetA.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the routing protocol for exchanging routing and reachability information between networks. When this protocol is used within VNets, it enables your Virtual Private Network (VPN) devices to exchange routes with your VPN gateways. BGP will tell the VPN gateways that the prefixes of the VPN devices are allowed to go through them.

---

## Q007:

Solution: Configure Azure Network Watcher

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

The solution does not meet the goal. Azure Network Watcher service enables you to monitor conditions at a network level in and from Azure. Configuring Azure Network Watcher will not allow both users to access VnetB.

## Q004-006:


Your company has a virtual network VNet1 configured as shown in the exhibit with an address space of 10.1.0.0/16.
There are three subnets inside this virtual network:

• 10.1.1.0/24
• 10.1.2.0/24
• 10.1.3.0/24

The following resources are configured under these subnets:

| Virtual Machine | IP Address |
|-----------------|------------|
| VM1 | 10.1.1.9 |
| Proxy-VM | 10.1.2.9 |
| Backend Database | 10.1.3.9 |


No custom route table is attached to any of the subnets.
The VM1 is the front end server, where all the initial requests will be received from the public Internet users. The backend database is only reachable via the Proxy-VM.
VM1 wants to reach the backend database, but all the requests should proxy through the Proxy-VM configured in the subnet 10.1.2.0/24.

## Q006:

Solution: In order to relay all the traffic from VM1 via Proxy-VM, you enable the IP forwarding on the Proxy- VM virtual machine Virtual Network Interface under the IP configuration. You also configure a custom route table and attach it to the VM1 subnet. The route table is configured to route all the traffic to IP address 10.1.2.9/32 as the next hop address and the route type set to virtual appliance.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. You should enable the IP forwarding on the Proxy-VM virtual machine Virtual Network Interface under the IP configuration. You should also configure a custom route table and attach it to VM1 subnet. The route table should be configured to route all the traffic to IP address 10.1.2.9/32 as the next hop address and route type set to virtual appliance. With this set-up in place, all the traffic from VM1 will be routed to Proxy-VM, which will be then forwarded to the next hop as per the IP packet destination IP address


---

## Q005:

Solution: In order to relay all the traffic from VM1 via Proxy-VM, you create a Network Security Group (NSG), which allows the traffic from VM1 subnet to the Backend Database subnet.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Simply creating a Network Security Group (NSG) to allow traffic from VM1 subnet to the Backend Database subnet will not help in relaying the traffic via the Proxy-VM. The NSG is used to configure different security rules for the inbound and the outbound traffic, and you can associate a subnet or a network interface to it.

---

## Q004:

Solution: In order to relay all the traffic from VM1 via Proxy-VM, you enable IP Forwarding on the Backend database virtual machine, Virtual Network Interface.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Simply enabling the IP forwarding on the Backend Database virtual machine Virtual Network Interface will not force the VM1 to send all its traffic to Proxy-VM.

You have a private DNS Zone named az700.practice.com. You have two VNets, each running a Windows 10 virtual machine:

• Windows10 in Vnet1
• Windows10-2 in Vnet2

Each virtual machine only has private IP addresses. Refer to exhibits 1, 2, 3 and the table below for current
set-up details.

![image info](./Q1_0.PNG)

You discover that Windows10 in VNet1 cannot communicate with Windows10-2 in VNet2 using domain names.

## Q003:

Solution: You create two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled. Additionally, you assign a public IP address to each virtual machine network interface.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Just creating two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled will not enable communication between the two virtual machines. Moreover, assigning public IP addresses to each virtual machine network interfaces will not help to enable communication between the virtual machines by using their private domain names. The public IP may help in accessing the virtual machine via the public internet, but it will not help in the private domain name resolution and reachability between the two virtual machines.

---

## Q002:

Solution: You create two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2. Additionally, you also configure peering between VNet1 and VNet2.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. In order to enable inter-VNet communication, you need to configure virtual network peering between VNet1 and VNet2. The virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 will enable hostname registration with the private zone. Once the virtual machine is created, the private IP will be automatically registered against the hostname in the private zone. To ensure actual connectivity between the virtual machines in different VNets, you need to configure peering between them.

---

## Q001:

Solution: 
You create two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Just creating two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled will not enable the communication between the two virtual machines. With this configuration, the hostname of the virtual machine will be automatically added to the private DNS Zone if the VM is spin up inside VNet1 or VNet2.
