## Q020-Q022:

You are an Azure network administrator for a transport company. Azure Firewall has been deployed to filter traffic in a hub and spoke topology. The Azure Firewall rules are currently empty and require configuration.
Your colleague has requested external network connectivity for one of the application servers, which is in one of the spoke virtual networks (VNets).
You need to allow the application server to connect to www.company1.com using Azure Firewall and custom Domain Name System (DNS) servers.

## Q022:

Solution: create a DNAT (Destination Network Address Translation) rule collection AND THEN CREATE A dnat RULE.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT) rules allow users to connect to private IP addresses behind Azure Firewall via the public interface (IP address). A common scenario for this type of rule is for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections to an Azure virtual machine from the internet. For instance, a business need could surface that requires a third party support provider to connect to one of your Azure virtual machines over the internet using RDP. This would be needed so that the third party support provider could efficiently support the application that is running on the virtual machine and to hit any agreed Service Level Agreements (SLAs). All the third party would require is the public IP address in order to connect via RDP to the virtual machine from their headquarters.

## Q021:

Solution: Add an application and network rule collection, and then create an application network rule.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. An application rule alone will not meet the requirement of the request. DNS connectivity on port 53 is also required, which must be configured as a network rule. As a result, you need to configure both an application and a network rule. During the network rule creation, you must map port 53 to the custom DNS servers.

## Q020:

Solution: Create an application rule collection, and then create an application rule.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. An application rule is based on Layer 7 of the Network OSI model. This will allow administrators to add a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the rule. For connectivity to www.company1.com to work, DNS on port 53 is also required, in the form of a network rule.

## Q017-Q019:

You work as an Azure administrator for a clothing company. You have two virtual machines configured with the below network settings. Network Security Groups (NSGs) have been assigned to the individual virtual machine Network Interface Cards (NICs) with the default rules.

| VM Name | VNET | Subnet | NSG |
|---|---|---|---|
| VM01 | VNET1 | SN1 | NSG1 |
| VM02 | VNET1 | SN2 | NSG2 |

Your colleague needs to connect to VMO2 from VM01 using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to test an application. You need to ensure that RDP access from VM01 to VMO2 will work.
The solution must not include any unnecessary administrative effort.

## Q019:

Solution: Do Nothing.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes


This solution meets the goal. You should do nothing. The Remote Desktop Protocol allows remote users to connect to another Microsoft Windows machine from another location. This can either be over the public internet or a local network. The AllowVNetInbound rule allows any traffic between virtual networks by default. This includes RDP connectivity between virtual machines.

---

### References

---

## Q018:

Solution: Create an inbound rule for port 3389 on NSG1 and NSG1.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. You should not create inbound and outgoing rules for port 3389 on both NSG1 and NSG2. The Remote Desktop Protocol allows remote users to connect to another Microsoft Windows machine from another location. This can either be over the public internet or a local network. NSGs consist of a rule labelled AllowVNetInBound. This rule allows all hosts inside the virtual network (including subnets) to communicate with each other.

---

## Q017:


Solution: Create an inbound rule for port 3389 on NSG2.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. You should not create an inbound rule for port 3389 on NSG2. The Remote Desktop Protocol allows remote users to connect to another Microsoft Windows machine from another location. This can either be over the public internet or a local network. An additional rule to explicitly allow RDP traffic is not required. This is due to the default Network Security Group (NSG) rules already permitting any traffic between virtual networks and virtual machines.

---

## Q014-Q016:

You work as an Azure administrator for a logistics company. You have an Azure subscription with the following resources:

| Resource Type | Resource Name | Azure Region |
|---|---|---|
| Virtual Network | Vnet1 | UK South |
| Virtual Machine | Vm1 | UK South |
| Storage Account | Storage1 | UK South |
| Storage Account | Storage2 | UK South |

You need to meet the following requirements:

- Vm1 needs to securely connect to Storage1 over the Azure backbone network.
- Resources in Vnet1 can only connect to Storage1 and no other storage accounts.

---

## Q016:


Solution: You deploy Azure Front Door and create a custom rules engine rule.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. You should not deploy Azure Front Door and create a custom rules engine rule. Azure Front Door is a global Layer 7 load-balancing service. Layer 7 refers to the Application layer of the Open Systems Interconnect model (OSI model). This can be useful if you have a number of virtual machines in different regions. Azure Front Door can be used to direct traffic (load balance) to the most appropriate virtual machine based on the source region of the end user. This ensures that the end user is always connecting to the closest virtual machine. Azure Front Door can be further customized by adding custom rules using the rules engine. This would not apply in this scenario as Azure Front Door is a service that is accessible from the internet. A rules engine rule can be used to redirect users to a mobile friendly website if the source device is a mobile.

## Q015:

Solution: You deploy a service endpoint and service endpoint policy.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. You should deploy a service endpoint and service endpoint policy. A service endpoint allows you to directly connect a subnet to a public Azure service such as storage accounts. This means that the virtual machine does not require an outbound connection to the internet, which is often a security concern. The relevant virtual network and subnet can then be associated to the storage account under the networking blade. This ensures that the first requirement is met, as Vm1 securely connects to the storage account over the Azure backbone network without making outgoing public calls via the internet. The secondary requirement is met by creating a service endpoint policy. If you create a service endpoint policy you can ensure that data exfiltration is not possible. For instance, during the service endpoint policy creation, you would need to ensure that you explicitly state that only Storage1 is accessible over the service endpoint. Access to other storage accounts will be denied from the subnet.

---

## Q014:

Solution: You deploy a private endpoint and Private Link service.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. You should not deploy a private endpoint and Private Link service. A private endpoint allows you to completely isolate an Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) service, such as a web app, so that it can only be contacted by an internal Azure resource. A private endpoint also allows traffic from on-premises networks to securely connect to the resource without traversing via the internet. This answer is not applicable for this scenario as the requirement does not state that private access from an on-premises network or virtual network is necessary. The scenario states that Vm1 needs to connect to Storage1 over the Azure backbone network only. For this reason, a private endpoint and private link service is an incorrect solution.

## Q010-013:

You are the Azure administrator in your organization. A virtual network (VNet) with three subnets has been deployed with three virtual machines. A Site-to-Site VPN tunnel was also configured to connect Azure to the on-premises data center.
You have received reports of latency issues between on-premises clients and the Azure virtual machines. You run Network Watcher VPN diagnostics.

You need to analyze the ingress and egress bytes for the VPN connection.

---

## Q013:

Solution: You configure and analyze Network Security Group Flow Logs.
Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. You should not configure and analyze Network Security Group (NSG) Flow Logs. Network Security Group flow logs is an optional feature that comes bundled with Network Watcher. These logs will allow you to analyze network traffic that passes through a Network Security Group. This diagnostic test does not apply to the requirement as it specifically requests ingress and egress bytes for the VPN tunnel. This specifically relates to all data that passes through a given Network Security Group. Analyzing the ingress and egress data can be useful to verify whether data is actually reaching the Network Security Group in the first place.

## Q012:

Solution: From Network Watcher, inspect the Connectiontats.txt file.
Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. From Network Watcher, you should inspect the 'ConnectionStats.txt' file. When you troubleshoot VPN connectivity, this file will contain statistics for the connection, which includes ingress and egress byte data.

## Q010:

Solution: From Network Watcher, inspect the IKEErrors.txt file.
Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. From Network Watcher, you should not inspect the 'IKEErrors.txt' file. This file will only report issues and errors relating to the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) component of the VPN tunnel. The IKE process allows VPN peers at both ends to successfully encrypt and decrypt network packets traveling over the VPN tunnel, using a mutually agreed pre-shared key or certificate. This process consists of two phases: phase 1 and phase 2. Each phase uses encryption algorithms and keys. The IKEErrors.txt file will list any issues encountered during either phase initiation.

## Q009:

Solution: re-download the VPN client configuration fpr the North US Windows user and the North US IOS user.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Downloading the VPN client configuration for users should only be done if the topology of a network is modified so that the changes of the topology can be implemented again to the client.

---

## Q008:

Solution: You use BGP on the gateway of VnetA.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the routing protocol for exchanging routing and reachability information between networks. When this protocol is used within VNets, it enables your Virtual Private Network (VPN) devices to exchange routes with your VPN gateways. BGP will tell the VPN gateways that the prefixes of the VPN devices are allowed to go through them.

---

## Q007:

Solution: Configure Azure Network Watcher

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

The solution does not meet the goal. Azure Network Watcher service enables you to monitor conditions at a network level in and from Azure. Configuring Azure Network Watcher will not allow both users to access VnetB.

## Q004-006:


Your company has a virtual network VNet1 configured as shown in the exhibit with an address space of 10.1.0.0/16.
There are three subnets inside this virtual network:

• 10.1.1.0/24
• 10.1.2.0/24
• 10.1.3.0/24

The following resources are configured under these subnets:

| Virtual Machine | IP Address |
|-----------------|------------|
| VM1 | 10.1.1.9 |
| Proxy-VM | 10.1.2.9 |
| Backend Database | 10.1.3.9 |


No custom route table is attached to any of the subnets.
The VM1 is the front end server, where all the initial requests will be received from the public Internet users. The backend database is only reachable via the Proxy-VM.
VM1 wants to reach the backend database, but all the requests should proxy through the Proxy-VM configured in the subnet 10.1.2.0/24.

## Q006:

Solution: In order to relay all the traffic from VM1 via Proxy-VM, you enable the IP forwarding on the Proxy- VM virtual machine Virtual Network Interface under the IP configuration. You also configure a custom route table and attach it to the VM1 subnet. The route table is configured to route all the traffic to IP address 10.1.2.9/32 as the next hop address and the route type set to virtual appliance.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. You should enable the IP forwarding on the Proxy-VM virtual machine Virtual Network Interface under the IP configuration. You should also configure a custom route table and attach it to VM1 subnet. The route table should be configured to route all the traffic to IP address 10.1.2.9/32 as the next hop address and route type set to virtual appliance. With this set-up in place, all the traffic from VM1 will be routed to Proxy-VM, which will be then forwarded to the next hop as per the IP packet destination IP address


---

## Q005:

Solution: In order to relay all the traffic from VM1 via Proxy-VM, you create a Network Security Group (NSG), which allows the traffic from VM1 subnet to the Backend Database subnet.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Simply creating a Network Security Group (NSG) to allow traffic from VM1 subnet to the Backend Database subnet will not help in relaying the traffic via the Proxy-VM. The NSG is used to configure different security rules for the inbound and the outbound traffic, and you can associate a subnet or a network interface to it.

---

## Q004:

Solution: In order to relay all the traffic from VM1 via Proxy-VM, you enable IP Forwarding on the Backend database virtual machine, Virtual Network Interface.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Simply enabling the IP forwarding on the Backend Database virtual machine Virtual Network Interface will not force the VM1 to send all its traffic to Proxy-VM.

## Q001-003:

![image info](./Q1_1.PNG)
![image info](./Q1_2.PNG)
![image info](./Q1_3.PNG)


You have a private DNS Zone named az700.practice.com. You have two VNets, each running a Windows 10 virtual machine:

• Windows10 in Vnet1
• Windows10-2 in Vnet2

Each virtual machine only has private IP addresses. Refer to exhibits 1, 2, 3 and the table below for current
set-up details.

![image info](./Q1_0.PNG)

You discover that Windows10 in VNet1 cannot communicate with Windows10-2 in VNet2 using domain names.

You need to ensure that both virtual machines can communicate with each other using their corresponding private domain names.

## Q003:

Solution: You create two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled. Additionally, you assign a public IP address to each virtual machine network interface.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Just creating two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled will not enable communication between the two virtual machines. Moreover, assigning public IP addresses to each virtual machine network interfaces will not help to enable communication between the virtual machines by using their private domain names. The public IP may help in accessing the virtual machine via the public internet, but it will not help in the private domain name resolution and reachability between the two virtual machines.

---

## Q002:

Solution: You create two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2. Additionally, you also configure peering between VNet1 and VNet2.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. In order to enable inter-VNet communication, you need to configure virtual network peering between VNet1 and VNet2. The virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 will enable hostname registration with the private zone. Once the virtual machine is created, the private IP will be automatically registered against the hostname in the private zone. To ensure actual connectivity between the virtual machines in different VNets, you need to configure peering between them.

---

## Q001:

Solution: 
You create two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Just creating two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled will not enable the communication between the two virtual machines. With this configuration, the hostname of the virtual machine will be automatically added to the private DNS Zone if the VM is spin up inside VNet1 or VNet2.
