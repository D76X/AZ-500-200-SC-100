You have a private DNS Zone named az700.practice.com. You have two VNets, each running a Windows 10 virtual machine:

• Windows10 in Vnet1
• Windows10-2 in Vnet2

Each virtual machine only has private IP addresses. Refer to exhibits 1, 2, 3 and the table below for current
set-up details.

You discover that Windows10 in VNet1 cannot communicate with Windows10-2 in VNet2 using domain names.

You need to ensure that both virtual machines can communicate with each other using their corresponding private domain names.

## Q003:

Solution: You create two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled. Additionally, you assign a public IP address to each virtual machine network interface.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Just creating two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled will not enable communication between the two virtual machines. Moreover, assigning public IP addresses to each virtual machine network interfaces will not help to enable communication between the virtual machines by using their private domain names. The public IP may help in accessing the virtual machine via the public internet, but it will not help in the private domain name resolution and reachability between the two virtual machines.

## Q002:

Solution: You create two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2. Additionally, you also configure peering between VNet1 and VNet2.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. In order to enable inter-VNet communication, you need to configure virtual network peering between VNet1 and VNet2. The virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 will enable hostname registration with the private zone. Once the virtual machine is created, the private IP will be automatically registered against the hostname in the private zone. To ensure actual connectivity between the virtual machines in different VNets, you need to configure peering between them.

## Q001:

Solution: 
You create two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Just creating two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled will not enable the communication between the two virtual machines. With this configuration, the hostname of the virtual machine will be automatically added to the private DNS Zone if the VM is spin up inside VNet1 or VNet2.
