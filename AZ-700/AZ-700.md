![image info](./Q7_1.PNG)

Your company has the Azure environment shown in the Network Architecture exhibit.
The North US Windows user and the North US IOS user can only access VnetA.
You need to implement a solution that enables both users to access VnetB.

## Q009:

Solution: re-download the VPN client configuration fpr the North US Windows user and the North US IOS user.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Downloading the VPN client configuration for users should only be done if the topology of a network is modified so that the changes of the topology can be implemented again to the client.

---

## Q008:

Solution: You use BGP on the gateway of VnetA.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the routing protocol for exchanging routing and reachability information between networks. When this protocol is used within VNets, it enables your Virtual Private Network (VPN) devices to exchange routes with your VPN gateways. BGP will tell the VPN gateways that the prefixes of the VPN devices are allowed to go through them.

## Q007:

Solution: Configure Azure Network Watcher

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

The solution does not meet the goal. Azure Network Watcher service enables you to monitor conditions at a network level in and from Azure. Configuring Azure Network Watcher will not allow both users to access VnetB.

## Q004-006:


Your company has a virtual network VNet1 configured as shown in the exhibit with an address space of 10.1.0.0/16.
There are three subnets inside this virtual network:

• 10.1.1.0/24
• 10.1.2.0/24
• 10.1.3.0/24

The following resources are configured under these subnets:

| Virtual Machine | IP Address |
|-----------------|------------|
| VM1 | 10.1.1.9 |
| Proxy-VM | 10.1.2.9 |
| Backend Database | 10.1.3.9 |


No custom route table is attached to any of the subnets.
The VM1 is the front end server, where all the initial requests will be received from the public Internet users. The backend database is only reachable via the Proxy-VM.
VM1 wants to reach the backend database, but all the requests should proxy through the Proxy-VM configured in the subnet 10.1.2.0/24.

## Q006:

Solution: In order to relay all the traffic from VM1 via Proxy-VM, you enable the IP forwarding on the Proxy- VM virtual machine Virtual Network Interface under the IP configuration. You also configure a custom route table and attach it to the VM1 subnet. The route table is configured to route all the traffic to IP address 10.1.2.9/32 as the next hop address and the route type set to virtual appliance.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. You should enable the IP forwarding on the Proxy-VM virtual machine Virtual Network Interface under the IP configuration. You should also configure a custom route table and attach it to VM1 subnet. The route table should be configured to route all the traffic to IP address 10.1.2.9/32 as the next hop address and route type set to virtual appliance. With this set-up in place, all the traffic from VM1 will be routed to Proxy-VM, which will be then forwarded to the next hop as per the IP packet destination IP address


---

## Q005:

Solution: In order to relay all the traffic from VM1 via Proxy-VM, you create a Network Security Group (NSG), which allows the traffic from VM1 subnet to the Backend Database subnet.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Simply creating a Network Security Group (NSG) to allow traffic from VM1 subnet to the Backend Database subnet will not help in relaying the traffic via the Proxy-VM. The NSG is used to configure different security rules for the inbound and the outbound traffic, and you can associate a subnet or a network interface to it.

---

## Q004:

Solution: In order to relay all the traffic from VM1 via Proxy-VM, you enable IP Forwarding on the Backend database virtual machine, Virtual Network Interface.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Simply enabling the IP forwarding on the Backend Database virtual machine Virtual Network Interface will not force the VM1 to send all its traffic to Proxy-VM.

## Q001-003:

![image info](./Q1_1.PNG)
![image info](./Q1_2.PNG)
![image info](./Q1_3.PNG)


You have a private DNS Zone named az700.practice.com. You have two VNets, each running a Windows 10 virtual machine:

• Windows10 in Vnet1
• Windows10-2 in Vnet2

Each virtual machine only has private IP addresses. Refer to exhibits 1, 2, 3 and the table below for current
set-up details.

![image info](./Q1_0.PNG)

You discover that Windows10 in VNet1 cannot communicate with Windows10-2 in VNet2 using domain names.

You need to ensure that both virtual machines can communicate with each other using their corresponding private domain names.

## Q003:

Solution: You create two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled. Additionally, you assign a public IP address to each virtual machine network interface.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Just creating two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled will not enable communication between the two virtual machines. Moreover, assigning public IP addresses to each virtual machine network interfaces will not help to enable communication between the virtual machines by using their private domain names. The public IP may help in accessing the virtual machine via the public internet, but it will not help in the private domain name resolution and reachability between the two virtual machines.

---

## Q002:

Solution: You create two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2. Additionally, you also configure peering between VNet1 and VNet2.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. In order to enable inter-VNet communication, you need to configure virtual network peering between VNet1 and VNet2. The virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 will enable hostname registration with the private zone. Once the virtual machine is created, the private IP will be automatically registered against the hostname in the private zone. To ensure actual connectivity between the virtual machines in different VNets, you need to configure peering between them.

---

## Q001:

Solution: 
You create two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled.

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Just creating two virtual network links with the private DNS Zone for VNet1 and VNet2 with auto registration set to Enabled will not enable the communication between the two virtual machines. With this configuration, the hostname of the virtual machine will be automatically added to the private DNS Zone if the VM is spin up inside VNet1 or VNet2.
