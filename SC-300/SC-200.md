## Q037:

You enable Microsoft Sentinel in your company.
Your manager wants to integrate log data from Microsoft 365 and non-Azure virtual machines.
You need to recommend a solution to fulfill the manager's request.

What solution should you recommend?

Choose the correct answer

- Using Data Loss Prevention policies
- Using Microsoft Graph
- Adding a playbook in Microsoft Sentinel
- Creating data connectors in Microsoft Sentinel

---

### Answer:
- Creating data connectors in Microsoft Sentinel

You should recommend creating data connectors in Microsoft Sentinel. Microsoft Sentinel data connectors are used by companies to integrate the log data from several sources like Microsoft 365, Azure resources, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, and non-Azure virtual machines. To use data connectors, you have to choose the Data Connectors tab on the left-hand side of the Microsoft Sentinel portal, then select the connector you want from a list. There are several types of connectors for different purposes, such as connecting Vectra Al Detect to Microsoft Sentinel or connecting Amazon Web Services to Microsoft Sentinel. Upon selecting the appropriate connector, you will be able to collect log data from the source that you choose.
You should not recommend adding a playbook in Microsoft Sentinel. Playbooks are sets of processes that may be executed in response to an alert or event from Microsoft Sentinel. A playbook uses automation in response to alerts, attaching an analysis rule or an automation rule when certain alerts or occurrences are produced. They cannot integrate log data from Microsoft 365 and non-Azure virtual machines.
You should not recommend using Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Graph uses a single API call to act on security insights from security solutions. It is a tool that enables users to create solutions that are authenticated once. This solution does not allow you to integrate log data. Microsoft Graph includes features like the calendar feature for Outlook, which allows users to set up appointments, and the files feature for SharePoint and OneDrive, which enables users to manage files on SharePoint and OneDrive.

You should not recommend using Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies. Using a DLP policy will allow you to ban the accidental sharing of sensitive information with people outside the organization. Data loss prevention can display a pop-up tip to employees to warn them about possible attempts to share sensitive data with people outside the organization, but it cannot integrate log data as required in the scenario.

## Q036:

The coordinator of the finance team reports that the Microsoft 365 data of a team member is compromised.
Your manager wants you to implement a solution that enables the company to collect log data.
You need to recommend a solution that fulfills the manager's request.

What solution should you recommend?

Choose the correct answer

- Microsoft Sentinel connectors
- Attack surface reduction rules
- Exemption rules
- Windows Security Events connector

---

### Answer:

You should recommend Microsoft Sentinel connectors. Through Microsoft Sentinel connectors, you can connect your data resources, such as Microsoft 365, to connectors found in Microsoft Sentinel. This will enable you to keep track of log data connected to the connectors, protecting this data from being compromised. Microsoft Sentinel is a Security Information Event Management (SIEM) system that provides security analytics for companies.
You should not recommend Exemption rules. Exemption rules are a part of Microsoft Defender for Cloud and they allow you to have precise control over the recommendations that influence the resources in your subscriptions and management groups. This solution does not enable you to collect Microsoft 365 data or log data.
You should not recommend the Windows Security Events connector. The Windows Security Events connector is used to stream security events from any Windows server linked with your Microsoft Sentinel workspace. This solution does not enable you to collect Microsoft 365 data or log data.
You should not recommend Attack Surface Reduction rules. These rules are used to protect an organization from being compromised through malicious scripts and executable files. This solution does not enable you to collect Microsoft 365 data or log data.

## Q035:

Your manager asks you to configure alerts in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint so that the members of the accounting team can receive alerts when a vulnerability is detected. You configure the alerts as requested. One of the employees reports that they are not receiving email notifications when a vulnerability is detected like their colleagues.
You need to make sure the employee receives the email notifications.

What should you do?

Choose the correct answer

- Delete the notification rule.
- Edit the created notification rule.
- Modify the Include tenant-specific portal link field of the notification rule.
- Check the employee's Junk Email folder and mark the security emails as Not Junk.

---

### Answer:
- Check the employee's Junk Email folder and mark the security emails as Not Junk.

You should check the employee's Junk Email folder for the security emails. Emails from Defender for Endpoints are occasionally sent to the Junk Email folder. Accessing this folder and marking the security emails as Not Junk will resolve the problem. Other potential causes of this problem include your email security product blocking email notifications from Defender for Endpoints, or your email application rules. catching and moving these notifications.
You should not edit the created rule for alert notifications. This action, done in the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will allow you to edit a created rule for email notifications by accessing the email notifications page and then selecting the rule you want to edit. There are several fields that you can edit in the created rule, like the rule name and the alert severity that will be displayed for the user receiving an email about the alert.
You should not delete the notification rule. Deleting the rule will prevent the employee from receiving any email notification related to a detected vulnerability.
You should not modify the Include tenant-specific portal link field of the notification rule. This action will allow you to reset a new link with a specific tenant ID to allow the notification to pass to a user in a specific tenant.

## Q034:

Your organization uses Microsoft Azure cloud, with resources located in the United States and Europe. Every geography has regulatory requirements for data retention.
You need to implement Microsoft Sentinel for your Security Operations Center (SOC) team. The estimated log data ingestion will exceed 100 GB per day per geography.

How many workspaces should you plan for your Microsoft Sentinel solution?

Choose the correct answer

- One
- Two
- Three
- Four

---

### Answer:
- Four

You should plan four workspaces for your Microsoft Sentinel solution. When you plan the implementation of Microsoft, it is essential to outline the architecture for your Log Analytics workspace. The design of the workspace architecture is usually influenced by both business and technical needs.
Based on Microsoft's best practices for Microsoft Sentinel workspace architecture, you should consider the following, among other factors:
â€¢ cost implications for different scenarios
any compliance requirements for data collection and storage
Considering the factors mentioned above, Microsoft recommends using a separate workspace for every 100 GB of data for cost efficiency. Additionally, it is suggested to separate the workspaces by geography. In this scenario, there are two geographies: the United States and Europe. Furthermore, due to log data ingestion exceeding 100 GB per day per geography, it will be necessary to implement two separate workspaces for each geography, respectively.
Note that while a geography in Azure represents a larger area encompassing multiple regions and ensuring data residency and compliance, a region refers to a specific geographical location where Azure resources such as Microsoft Sentinel workspace can be deployed and hosted.

## Q033:

You have a Microsoft Sentinel security information and event management (SIEM) and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solution running in an Azure subscription.
You are assigning Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) permissions for the below users in Microsoft Sentinel:

- User1, a security analyst, needs to attach playbooks to analytics and automation rules, as well as run playbooks.
- User2, a security engineer, needs to manage incidents, such as assigning or dismissing them.

User3, a service principal, needs to manage automated configuration for management tasks (e.g., creating and updating support tickets), create and edit analytics rules.
You need to assign the appropriate roles for the users as per their user type and according to Microsoft's recommendations.

Which role should you assign to each user? 
To answer, drag the appropriate role to each user. A role may be used once, more than once, or not at all.

Drag and drop the answers

Sentinel Playbook Operator
Sentinel Contributor
Sentinel Responder
Logic App Contributor

User1: Sentinel Playbook Operator
User2: Sentinel Responder
User3: Sentinel Contributor

---

### Answer:

Microsoft Sentinel uses Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to provide built-in roles that can be assigned to users, groups, and services in Azure. There are five Microsoft Sentinel-specific roles: Microsoft Sentinel Reader, Microsoft Sentinel Responder, Microsoft Sentinel Contributor, Microsoft Sentinel Playbook Operator and Microsoft Sentinel Automation Contributor. In addition to these roles, the Logic App Contributor role can also be assigned to allow the user to view, run, create or edit playbooks.
In this scenario, User1 is a security analyst and needs to attach playbooks to analytics and automation rules and, additionally, to run playbooks. According to Microsoft's recommendations, this user should be assigned the Microsoft Sentinel Playbook Operator role.
User2 is a security engineer and needs to manage incidents, which includes tasks such as assigning or dismissing incidents. According to Microsoft's recommendations, this user should be assigned the Microsoft Sentinel Responder role.
User3 is a service principal and can manage automated configuration for management tasks, create and edit analytics rules. According to Microsoft's recommendations, this user should be assigned the Microsoft Sentinel Contributor role.
You should not assign the Logic App Contributor role to any of these users. According to Microsoft's recommendations, this role is targeted towards the Security Engineer user type for Microsoft Sentinel's resource group, or the resource group where your playbooks are stored. This role also allows a user to attach playbooks to analytics and automation rules, in addition to running and modifying the playbooks.

## Q032:

Your company starts using Microsoft Sentinel.
The manager wants the administration of the implemented solution to be divided into two groups, Group A and Group B, where:
Group A is responsible for replacing tags in Threat Intelligence Indicator.
Group B is responsible for adding playbooks to automation rules.
You need to assign the appropriate roles for both groups to fulfill the manager's request.
How should you assign the roles? To answer, drag the appropriate role to each group. A role may be used once, more than once, or not at all.

Drag and drop the answers

Responder
Sentinel Automation Contributor
Reader
Security Assessment Contributor

Group A: Responder
Group B: Sentinel Automation Contributor

---

### Answer:

You should assign the Responder role to Group A. This role gives the user permission to manage incidents (assign users to incidents, dismiss alerts, etc.) in Microsoft Sentinel and to view several Microsoft Sentinel resources, including reports, incidents, and workbooks. This role also gives users permission to replace tags in Threat Intelligence Indicator. It does not give users permission to add playbooks to automation rules. Threat Intelligence Indicator is a cloud-based solution used within companies to analyze and act upon threat activities.
You should assign the Microsoft Sentinel Automation Contributor role to Group B. In addition to viewing Microsoft Sentinel resources, managing incidents, and working with workbooks, this role allows users to add playbooks to automation rules in Microsoft Sentinel.
You should not assign the Reader role to either group. This role gives a user permission to view incidents in Microsoft Sentinel, but not the permission to replace tags in Threat Intelligence Indicator or to add playbooks to automation rules as required in the scenario.
You should not assign the Security Assessment Contributor role to either group. This role gives users permission to create security assessments on the company's Microsoft Sentinel subscription, which is useful for finding out whether the company needs another Microsoft Sentinel subscription. This role does not give the permission to replace tags of Threat Intelligence Indicator or to add playbooks to automation rules as required in the scenario.

## Q031:

You are deploying Microsoft Sentinel and want to assign roles to users.
You need to ensure that all users are able to create and edit workbooks, analytics rules, and other Microsoft Sentinel resources.

Which two roles could you assign to these users to meet the requirements?
Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

Choose the correct answers

- Microsoft Sentinel Reader
- Microsoft Sentinel Contributor and Logic App Contributor
- Microsoft Sentinel Contributor
- Microsoft Sentinel Responder

---

### Answer:
- Microsoft Sentinel Contributor and Logic App Contributor
- Microsoft Sentinel Contributor

You should assign users either the Microsoft Sentinel Contributor role or the Microsoft Sentinel Contributor and Logic App Contributor role. Both of these options allow users to create and edit workbooks, analytics rules, and other Microsoft Sentinel resources. The Microsoft Sentinel Contributor and Logic App Contributor role also adds the ability to create and run playbooks.
You should not assign users the Microsoft Sentinel Responder role. Users with this role can manage incidents (dismissing and assigning incidents, for example) and also view data incidents, workbooks, and other Microsoft Sentinel resources.
You should not assign users the Microsoft Sentinel Reader role. Users with this role only have the permissions to view data incidents, workbooks, and other Microsoft Sentinel resources. It is the least privileged of all the Microsoft Sentinel roles.

## Q030:

You are in the process of implementing Microsoft Sentinel.
Your manager wants the log data to be kept in the company's workspace for 550 days.
You need to recommend a solution that fulfills the manager's request.

What should you recommend?

Choose the correct answer

- Create sensitivity labels in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
- Use security extensions in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
- Use data retention in the Azure portal.
- Create a workbook in the Azure portal.

---

### Answer:
- Use data retention in the Azure portal.

You should recommend using data retention in the Azure portal. Data retention is an option in the Azure portal that allows you to adjust the log retention days. This solution is applied by accessing the Data Retention window on the Usage and estimated costs page, where a blade for retention days will be displayed for you to adjust. Using this blade, you can set the data retention period to 30, 31, 60, 90, 120, 180, 270, 365, 550, or 730 days. 31 days is the default setting and 730 is the maximum number of days allowed. Data will be retained in Microsoft Azure servers
You should not recommend creating a workbook in the Azure portal. Workbooks provide a broad canvas for data analysis and the production of sophisticated visual reports. They enable you to connect to numerous data sources throughout Azure and integrate them into cohesive interactive experiences. However, workbooks will not allow you to keep log data for a defined period of time.
You should not recommend creating sensitivity labels in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. Sensitivity labels allow you to protect and classify the company's data while making sure that employees can effectively collaborate. When a sensitivity label is applied to content, it can restrict access to content by adding a mark to a specific document (like watermarks applied on documents) or by using encryption.
You should not recommend using security extensions in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. This solution is used to collect data and send information on specific resource kinds after being scanned by the Log Analytics Agent tool. It will not allow you to keep log data as the manager requests.

## Q029:

Your manager wants an employee in the human resources department to be able to manage incidents and view resources in Microsoft Sentinel, but they should have no other permissions.
You need to grant the employee the appropriate permissions.

What role should you assign to the employee?

Choose the correct answer

- Microsoft Sentinel Reader
- Microsoft Sentinel Responder
- Microsoft Sentinel Contributor and Logic App Contributor
- Microsoft Sentinel Contributor

---

### Answer:
- Microsoft Sentinel Responder

You should assign the employee the Microsoft Sentinel Responder role. This role gives them permission to manage incidents (assign users to incidents, dismiss alerts, etc.) in Microsoft Sentinel and to view several Microsoft Sentinel resources, including reports, incidents, and workbooks. It does not give them any other permissions, so they could not create playbooks or analytics rules, for example.
You should not assign the employee the Microsoft Sentinel Contributor role. This role would give them permission to manage and view incidents in Microsoft Sentinel, but it also grants users permission to create and edit analytics rules.
You should not assign the employee the Microsoft Sentinel Reader role. This role would give them permission to view incidents in Microsoft Sentinel, but not permission to manage incidents.
You should not assign the employee the Microsoft Sentinel Contributor and Logic App Contributor roles. These roles would allow them to manage and view incidents in Microsoft Sentinel, and it would also give them the ability to create playbooks and analytics rules.

## Q028:

You have been tasked with enabling Microsoft Sentinel in an Azure tenant with multiple resource groups.
You need the correct role to be able to complete this task, while following the principle of least privilege and minimizing administrative effort.

What role should you be assigned?

Choose the correct answer

- Reader on the subscription that contains the Microsoft Sentinel workspace
- Reader on the resource group that contains the Microsoft Sentinel workspace
- Contributor on the subscription that contains the Microsoft Sentinel workspace
- Contributor on the resource group that contains the Microsoft Sentinel workspace

---

### Answer:
- Contributor on the subscription that contains the Microsoft Sentinel workspace

You should be assigned the Contributor role on the subscription that contains the Microsoft Sentinel workspace. In addition to all of the permissions provided with the Reader role, with the Contributor role, you can create and edit all Microsoft Sentinel resources. It is the only role that allows a user to deploy Microsoft Sentinel, and it must be applied at the subscription level as that is where Sentinel must be deployed. Assigning the permissions at the subscription level will propagate down to all resource groups, which means less administrative effort.
You should not be assigned the Reader role on the subscription that contains the Microsoft Sentinel workspace or on the resource group that contains the Microsoft Sentinel workspace. The Reader role is not enough to enable Microsoft Sentinel regardless of where those permissions are granted. This only allows for the review of Sentinel data after it has been deployed. Although it is often a great choice for least privilege, in this scenario, it would not be enough to get the task completed.
You should not be assigned the Contributor role on the resource group only, as this role will need to be assigned for the entire subscription. As Microsoft Sentinel will be aggregating data from across your entire subscription, having the Contributor role at that level is critical for the specific task of initially deploying the solution.

## Q027:

Your organization uses Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platforms.
You implement Microsoft Defender for Cloud CSPM service to scan vulnerabilities and compliance issues in your environment.
You need to identify the process by which the AWS Identity provider validates the Microsoft Entra token against the Microsoft Entra ID before a vulnerabilities and compliance scan can take place.

Which three validation conditions are included in this process? 
Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

Choose the correct answers

- audience validation
- expiration check
- token digital signature validation
- certificate thumbprint
- Issuer validation

---

### Answer:
- audience validation
- token digital signature validation
- certificate thumbprint

Cloud security posture management (CSPM) is part of the broader Microsoft Defender for Cloud suite, which also includes services for threat protection, identity and access management, and data protection. It supports various cloud platforms, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Validation conditions for AWS identity provider include:

- audience validation
- token digital signature validation
- certificate thumbprint

Audience validation ensures that the token is intended for the specific application or service that is trying to
use it. This helps prevent token misuse or replay attacks.
Token digital signature validation ensures that the token was indeed issued by a trusted authority and has not been tampered with.

Certificate thumbprint validation checks whether the thumbprint of the certificate used to sign the token matches the expected thumbprint. This helps ensure that the certificate used to sign the token is the one expected by the system.

Issuer validation and expiration check are not directly related to the validation of the Microsoft Entra token against Microsoft Entra ID, as they pertain to different aspects of token validation or management.

## Q026:

You manage a complex heterogeneous infrastructure across various clouds, data centers, edge locations, and on-premises servers in a centralized, unified way. The IT department faces challenges in implementing a centralized, unified way of protecting this diverse environment.
You need a solution to streamline management and reduce complexity.
What is the most efficient solution that you should implement to meet the requirements?

Choose the correct answer

- Windows Server Update Services
- Operations Manager
- Azure Arc
- Configuration manager

---

### Answer:
- Azure Arc

You should implement Azure Arc. Azure Arc is the most efficient solution for managing a complex infrastructure across various clouds, data centers, and edge locations, with on-premises servers. Azure Arc is a set of technologies that extends Azure management and services to any infrastructure. It enables you to manage servers, Kubernetes clusters, and Azure data services across multiple environments, including on- premises, multi-cloud, and edge locations. With Azure Arc, you can use Azure management tools, such as Azure Policy, Azure Monitor, and Azure Security Center to manage resources consistently and centrally. This helps to streamline management, reduce complexity, and improve security and compliance across your entire infrastructure.
You should not implement Configuration Manager and Operations Manager. These solutions are part of Microsoft System Center, which is a suite of management tools for on-premises data centers. While these tools can help manage on-premises infrastructure, they may not be as effective for managing resources across various clouds, data centers, and edge locations.
You should not implement Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), WSUS is a tool for deploying updates to Windows servers in an on-premises environment. While this is an important aspect of managing on- premises servers, it does not address the broader challenges of managing a diverse infrastructure across multiple environments.

## Q025:

To reduce the attack surface, a company's security department initiated a project to discover unmanaged network devices by leveraging the new network device discovery capabilities available in the Device inventory of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
After several days, you notice that no new discovered devices are visible in the scan results.

Which three actions should you perform to resolve the issue? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

Choose the correct answers

- Verify special configuration for Web Proxy Auto-discovery Protocol (WPAD).
- Verify that SNMP write access is enabled.
- Verify SNMP credentials.
- Verify that SNMP read-only access is enabled.
- Verify that SNMP traffic is allowed.

---

### Answer:

- Verify SNMP credentials.
- Verify that SNMP read-only access is enabled.
- Verify that SNMP traffic is allowed.

You should verify that SNMP traffic is allowed. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is used by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to discover unmanaged network devices. If SNMP traffic is blocked or not allowed in the network, the discovery process will not work properly. Verifying that SNMP traffic is allowed ensures that the necessary communication can take place for device discovery.

You should also verify that SNMP read-only access is enabled. SNMP read-only access is typically sufficient for device discovery. Enabling only read access ensures that no unauthorized changes can be made to the devices being discovered. This is important for security reasons.

You should verify SNMP credentials too. The correct SNMP credentials are crucial for successful device discovery. If the credentials provided are incorrect or outdated, the discovery process will fail. Verifying that the correct credentials are being used ensures that the discovery process can access the devices.
You should not verify that SNMP write access is enabled. SNMP write access allows for the modification of device settings. However, write access is not typically needed for device discovery and can pose security risks. Therefore, it is recommended to only enable read-only access for SNMP.
You should not verify special configuration for Web Proxy Auto-discovery Protocol (WPAD). WPAD is used to automatically configure proxy settings for devices on a network. If Transparent proxy or WPAD is part of your network topology, no additional configuration settings are required.

## Q024:

You work for an organization that uses multiple Azure subscriptions to host Azure Cloud resources and has activated Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Defender for Cloud has identified unprotected resources, which you have remediated.

You utilize the Microsoft Defender for Cloud REST API to list secure scores for all your Cloud initiatives, and it provides the following output:

```
{
    "value": [ 
    {
        "id": "/subscriptions/10ac6cf1-d234-23ac-fk82x- a12547asgd31/providers/Microsoft.Security/secureScores/ascScore",
        "name": "ascScore",
        "type": "Microsoft.Security/secureScores",
        "properties": {
            "displayName": "ASC score",
            "score": {
                "max": 43,
                "current": 29.12,
                "percentage": 0.6772
            },        
        "weight": 77}
        }
    ]
}
```

Based on the security principle "Trust but verify," you need to verify the security posture using the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Secure Score.

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.

The current score is calculated using [Score per resource] * [Number of healthy resources]/[Number of unhealthy resources].
No

The relative weight for the Azure subscription 10ac6cf1-d234-23ac-fk82x- a12547asgd31 is 77.
Yes

To improve the Secure Score, you need to calculate the potential score increase and then apply remediation steps.
Yes

---

### Answer:

In the output provided, the current score is not calculated using: 

`[Score per resource] [Number of healthy resources]/[Number of unhealthy resources) `

The properties.score.current property, which provides the subscription's current score is calculated using: 

`[Score per resource] * [Number of healthy resources)`

The relative weight for the Azure subscription `10ac6cf1-d234-23ac-fk82x-a12547asgd31` is 77. 

The weight property is the relative weight of a specific Azure subscription. This weight property is used when we want to calculate an aggregated Microsoft Defender for Cloud Secure Score for multiple subscriptions.

To improve the Secure Score, you need to calculate the potential score increase and then apply remediation steps. Potential Score is calculated using [Score per resource] [Number of unhealthy resources]. The remaining points that are available within the control are provided by the potential score increase.

## Q023:

You are using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and configuring roles for users. You are configuring roles for a Microsoft Entra group.
You need to assign a permission for a user that will allow them to manage email notifications in the Microsoft Defender XDR portal.

Which permission should you assign to the user?

Choose the correct answer

- View data - Defender Vulnerability Management
- View data - Security operations
- Active remediation actions - Security operations
- Manage security settings in Security Center

---

### Answer:
- Manage security settings in Security Center

You should assign Manage security settings in Security Center. This permission will allow the user to
manage the security settings in the Security Center, including permission to manage email notifications for
users in the Microsoft Defender XDR portal. With this permission, the user could enable an option to send
an email to users when an attack occurs, for example. The security settings also include the option to
implement folder exclusion for automation, which is used when an automated investigation is carried out
regarding specific folders where you can mark the folders that you want the automated investigation to skip.
You should not assign the View Data - Security operations permission. This permission would allow the user to view the data of security operations performed in the Microsoft Defender XDR portal.
You should not assign the View Data - Defender Vulnerability Management permission. This permission would allow the user to view data related to threat and vulnerability management in the Microsoft Defender XDR portal.
You should not assign the Active remediation actions Security operations permission. This permission. would allow the user to approve remediation actions or decline them in the Microsoft Defender XDR portal.

## Q022:

You use Microsoft 365 for Business in your organization.

To enhance security incident visibility, you have integrated Microsoft Defender XDR by connecting it to Microsoft Sentinel. Following an identity compromise, you acquired Microsoft Entra ID Protection licenses.
You need to ensure that the alerts and incidents from the newly purchased product are directed to Microsoft Sentinel.

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.


The newly purchased product will be automatically connected to Microsoft Sentinel in the background.
Yes

Connecting the newly purchased product to Microsoft Sentinel incurs additional fees.
No

The alerts and incidents from the new product will flow into Microsoft Sentinel without the need for further configuration.
Yes

---

### Answer:

The newly purchased product will be automatically connected to Microsoft Sentinel in the background. All integrated components and services are connected in the background when Microsoft Defender XDR is connected to Microsoft Sentinel. Therefore, when Microsoft Entra ID Protection is acquired, it is seamlessly integrated with Microsoft Sentinel without the need for additional configuration.
Connecting the newly purchased product to Microsoft Sentinel does not incur additional fees. When Microsoft Entra ID Protection licenses are acquired after the integration of Microsoft Defender XDR, the alerts and incidents from this new product are directed to Microsoft Sentinel without incurring extra fees. No additional charges are applied for connecting the newly purchased product with Microsoft Sentinel.
The alerts and incidents from the new product will flow into Microsoft Sentinel without the need for further configuration. The integration process is straightforward and does not need manual intervention.

## Q019-Q021:

Your company uses Microsoft Sentinel for threat detection.
Your manager reports that a significant number of Azure Storage account keys were recently enumerated without anyone being notified about the incident.
You need to configure Microsoft Sentinel to immediately alert you when such an incident occurs.

---

## Q021:

Solution: Create a hunting bookmark.
Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Hunting bookmarks are a Microsoft Sentinel tool that allows you to preserve queries that have already run in the Microsoft Sentinel Logs service, in addition to the query results. This solution also allows you to add notes and tags in order to record your contextual observations for incidents, but it does not allow you to send alerts upon detecting the enumeration of Azure Storage keys.

## Q020:

Solution: Create a hunting livestream.
Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. To receive immediate alerts when Azure Storage account keys are enumerated, you should create a hunting livestream. Hunting livestreams are a tool in Microsoft Sentinel that allows you to use hunting queries for events, then receive a notification when an event matches the specification in a query. This solution means that you can create a livestream for the event of Azure Storage keys being enumerated and receive notifications whenever this incident occurs. To create a hunting livestream, you should access the Hunting page in the Microsoft Sentinel portal, locate a hunting query to use on the Queries tab, and then add a livestream to it.

## Q019:

Solution: Create an analytics rule.
Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Microsoft Sentinel Analytics Rules are a feature of Microsoft Sentinel, a cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) platform. These rules are used to detect security threats and unusual activity in your environment by analyzing the data that flows through Azure
Sentinel.
Microsoft Sentinel Analytics Rules are created using a query language called Kusto Query Language (KQL), which is used to define the logic for identifying specific security events or patterns of activity that may indicate a security breach. These rules can be configured to trigger alerts, create incidents, or take other automated actions in response to specific security events. Although Microsoft Sentinel Analytics Rules can trigger alerts for your security operation center (SOC) team to triage, investigate and respond to threats, the alert is not triggered immediately, as requested in this scenario.

## Q016-Q018:

Your manager wants Microsoft Teams to send a message to the Security channel whenever there is an intended sign-in from a suspicious IP address. They ask you to find a solution.
You need to fulfill the manager's request.

---

## Q018:

Solution: Create a Palybook and assign it to an incident.
Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. To complete the manager's request, you should create a playbook in Microsoft Sentinel and assign it to an incident. Playbooks are sets of processes that may be executed in response to an alert or event. A playbook uses automation in responding to alerts by attaching an analysis rule or an automation rule when certain alerts or occurrences are produced. Assigning a playbook to an incident will allow you to use the playbook to provide the desired response, such as having a message sent from Microsoft Teams when a suspicious login is detected. In order to associate or assign a playbook to an incident, an automation rule should be created on the Microsoft Sentinel portal.

## Q017:


Solution: Create a Workbook.
Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Workbooks in the Azure portal provide a broad canvas for data
analysis and the production of sophisticated visual reports. They enable you to connect to numerous data
sources throughout Azure and integrate them into cohesive interactive experiences. Workbooks do not
allow Microsoft Teams to send a message upon an incident occurring as required in the scenario.

## Q016:


Solution: Use the Microsoft Graph security API.
Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Microsoft Graph is a tool that enables users to create solutions that are authenticated once and use a single API call to act on security insights from security solutions. The Microsoft Graph security API connects Microsoft security products, services, and partners in order to improve threat protection, detection, and response capabilities. Microsoft Graph includes features like the calendar feature for Outlook, which allows users to set up appointments, and the files feature for SharePoint and OneDrive, which enables users to manage files on SharePoint and OneDrive.

## Q013-Q015:

You use Microsoft Defender for Office 365 in your organization. Your organization is overwhelmed with suspicious emails containing potentially harmful attachments. You configure an automated investigation in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to deescalate the situation, but suspicious emails flood is not reduced.

You need to resolve the issue.

---

## Q015:

Solution: You configure a policy alert trigger based on unusual activity.
Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. By configuring a policy alert trigger based on unusual activity, you can effectively address the issue of an overwhelming flood of suspicious emails containing potentially harmful attachments. Microsoft sets a baseline value to determine the typical frequency of the chosen activity. This baseline is established over a period of up to seven days, during which no alerts will be generated. Once the baseline is set, an alert will be activated if the frequency of the activity monitored by the alert policy significantly surpasses the established baseline value.
This alert trigger will enable Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to detect and respond to unusual patterns or behaviors associated with suspicious emails, helping to reduce the flood of such emails and enhance overall security posture.

## Q014:


Solution: You customize and enable an alert policy.
Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. Customizing and enabling an alert policy can effectively address the challenge of managing the influx of suspicious emails with potentially harmful attachments. By tailoring alert policies to detect and respond to such threats, organizations can enhance their ability to identify and mitigate security risks more efficiently.
Microsoft Defender for Office 365 generates billions of signals daily to detect various types of malicious emails. If an email is automatically blocked, deleted, or otherwise neutralized, no alert is generated, as no further action is required from the security team.
In cases where suspicious emails are not identified and neutralized before delivery, no alert is generated. Several typical reasons for this include Zero-hour Auto Purge (ZAP), user-initiated security incidents resulting from inadvertent engagement with malicious content (such as clicking on phishing links or downloading malware), URLs weaponized at the time of click, and other factors.
To address this issue, specific alert policies need to be configured to trigger alerts when suspicious activities are detected. These alerts can then be investigated by the security team, or an automated investigation can be initiated.

## Q013:

Solution: You create a security playbook.
Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

The solution does not meet the goal. A security playbook is a predefined set of procedures or actions that are triggered automatically or manually in response to specific security incidents or events. These playbooks outline the steps to be taken to investigate, mitigate, and remediate security threats or breaches effectively and efficiently. They typically include a sequence of actions, such as gathering additional information, analyzing logs or data, notifying relevant stakeholders, applying containment measures, and initiating remediation actions. While creating a security playbook is a useful measure in reducing suspicious emails flood, some additional steps must occur, before a security playbook can start running.

## Q009-Q012:

> General Backgrounf

You work at a company that specializes in managing information systems. The company's main office is based in your region and has several branches outside your country. The company uses Microsoft Sentinel.

> Current Environment

- A user in the IT department has created a storage account in Azure for their own personal use without their coordinator noticing.

- A member of the accounting team reports that several workbooks related to customers' data have been deleted in the Microsoft Sentinel workspace of the company.

- A member of the IT department reports that five incidents of high severity occurred in the past week.

- A new employee starts working at your company. You create a new account for the employee in Microsoft Entra ID. A colleague of the new employee reports that the new employee created a role assignment the moment they started working on their company device.

> New Environment

- An analytics rule should be created where the rule query logic will alert the IT coordinator when any user creates a storage account.

- The manager wants to view all delete operations performed in the company's Microsoft Sentinel workspace.

- The manager wants to run an investigation about the incidents occurring within the past 10 days so better analysis can be achieved.

- The manager wants to know when any new user in Microsoft Entra ID creates a role assignment.

---

## Q012:

You need to create a query for the rule logic to alert the IT coordinator when a storage account is created, as requested.
How should you complete the query? To answer, complete the commands by selecting the correct parts from the drop-down menus.

OPT1:
OperationName
Update Case Comments
Update Cases

OPT2:
ActivityStatusValue
OperationName
Update Settings

```
AzureActivity
| where [OPT1] == "Create Storage Account"
| where [OPT2] == "Succeeded"
| make-series dcount (ResourceId) default=0 on EventSubmissionTimestamp
in range (ago (7d), now(), 1d) by Caller
```

```
AzureActivity
| where OperationName == "Create Storage Account"
| where ActivityStatusValue == "Succeeded"
| make-series dcount (ResourceId) default=0 on EventSubmissionTimestamp
in range (ago (7d), now(), 1d) by Caller
```

---

### Answer:

You should complete the query as follows:

```
AzureActivity 
| where OperationName == "Create Storage Account 
| where ActivityStatusValue == "Succeed"
| make-series dcount (Resourceld) default=0 on EventSubmissionTimestamp in range (ago (7d), now(), id) by Caller
```

You should use OperationName in the first line. This expression is a required expression in the query for the
rule being created. OperationName is the expression that is used to define the operation that the IT
coordinator should be notified about. You can see that the expression is followed by the Create Storage Account expression, so the coordinator will be notified upon the creation of a storage account, as requested.
You should not use Update cases in the first line. This expression defines the action of updating a case when you investigate it. This is part of the Security Insights category, not Azure Activity.
You should not use Create case comments in the first line. This expression defines the action of creating comments for cases being investigated, which is a beneficial activity while investigating a case. This activity is also part of the Security Insights category and not Azure Activity.
You should use Activity Status Value in the second line. This expression is required in the above query to define if the activity performed by the user succeeded and, for example, if account storage is created. In such a way, the rule would detect that the activity has been done successfully in order to inform the IT coordinator about it. The Activity Status Value expression can be followed by succeeded or failed expressions. The last portion of the provided query is also required to count all the records within your Azure that match the conditions you specify related to the defined activity of creating a storage account during the specified time frame.
You should not use OperationName in the second line. This expression is used to define the activity performed by a user, as seen in the first line. There is no 'succeeded' operation or activity in the query.
You should not use Update settings in the second line. This expression defines the activity of updating settings in Security Insights. It cannot be used here for two reasons: the first is that this is not the required activity, and the second is that this expression cannot be used to define if the operation succeeded or not.

---

## Q011:

You need to use the AzureActivity table query to fulfill the manager's request of viewing delete operations.

```
AzureActivity
| where OperationNameValue contains "?"
| where OperationName contains "?"
| where ActivityStatusValue contains "Succeeded"
```

Which two sections of code should you use to complete the query? 
Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

- ago(1d)
- SecurityInsights
- Delete alert rules
- Delete data connectors
- Delete workflow
- Delete

---

### Answer:
- SecurityInsights
- Delete

You should complete the query as follows:

1. AzureActivity
2. | where OperationNameValue contains "SecurityInsights"
3. | where OperationName contains "Delete"
4. | where ActivityStatusValue contains "Succeeded"

You should use SecurityInsights in line 2. This filter condition narrows down the results to only those logs where the OperationNameValue field contains the term SecurityInsights. This ensures that only activities related to security insights are included in the results.
Additionally, you should use Delete in line 3. This further filters the logs to only include records where the Operation Name field contains the term Delete. This filters for delete operations specifically, such as deleting resources or configurations related to security insights.
You should not use ago(1d). This expression is used to define time. This expression could be used in another query that states, for example, the operations carried out in the workspace in the past 24 hours. In this scenario, you need to define where you can view delete operations.
You should not use Delete workflow. This expression defines the activity of deleting a workflow in Microsoft Sentinel performed by a user. This expression is not related to deleting a workbook. Workflows in Microsoft Sentinel are created for several reasons, such as to create an automated response for alerts where Microsoft Sentinel acts upon suspicious activity done by a user.
You should not use Delete data connectors. This expression is related to the operation of deleting a data connector. Data connectors are used to connect data resources with each other upon implementing Microsoft Sentinel. This operation is not mentioned in the scenario.
You should not use Delete alert rules. This expression is related to deleting alert rules. Alert rules are configured within analytics rules to alert the user when a match occurs. Analytic rules detect and identify threats by matching the presence of signs and signals that impact the existence of a cyber-attack. They can also identify the origin of a cyber-attack and the potential loss of data that occurred due to the attack. This is not a mentioned requirement in the scenario.

---

## Q010:

You need to find a solution that provides data for the manager about creating new role assignments.
What action should you perform?

- Use the SecurityIncident table in Microsoft Sentinel.
- Use data retention in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- Use a Windows Security Events connector.
- Use Azure Lighthouse.

---

### Answer:
- Use the SecurityIncident table in Microsoft Sentinel.

You should use the SecurityIncident table in Microsoft Sentinel. This table is found in the Logs section in Microsoft Sentinel, where you can view all the incidents that are created or updated, including those related to creating role assignments by new users. This meets the scenario requirement. Every time an incident is created or updated, a new log is added to the SecurityIncident table.
You should not use data retention in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Data retention is used for retaining data, like documents and files, that you need, and getting rid of items that you do not need. Data retention cannot be used to view the logs of creating a new role assignment.
You should not use Azure Lighthouse. Azure Lighthouse is a solution that allows you to manage an Microsoft Sentinel workspace outside your tenant. Microsoft Sentinel is a security information event management (SIEM) system that provides security analytics for companies. Azure Lighthouse will not provide data about creating new role assignments.
You should not use a Windows Security Events connector. Windows Security Events connector is used to stream security events from any Windows server linked with your Microsoft Sentinel workspace. Nothing in the scenario mentions a Windows server.

## Q009:

You need to recommend a solution that enables you to run an investigation as required by the manager.

Which solution should you recommend?

- Create a hunting bookmark.
- Use Microsoft Graph.
- Create a workbook in Microsoft Sentinel.
- Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policies.

---

### Answer:
- Create a workbook in Microsoft Sentinel.

You should recommend creating a workbook in Microsoft Sentinel. Workbooks in the Azure portal provide a broad canvas for data analysis and the production of sophisticated visual reports. They enable you to connect to numerous data sources throughout Azure and integrate them into cohesive interactive experiences. In addition to that, they use queries to run investigations related to incidents occurring in the company within a defined time frame, such as 10 days before the incident occurred. This option meets the scenario requirement.
You should not recommend creating a hunting bookmark. Hunting bookmarks are a Microsoft Sentinel tool that allow you to preserve queries that have already run in the Microsoft Sentinel - Logs service, in addition to the query results. This solution also allows you to add notes and tags in order to record your contextual observations for incidents. This does not meet the scenario requirement.
You should not recommend using Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies. Using a DLP policy will allow you to ban the accidental sharing of sensitive information with people outside the organization. DLP can display a pop-up tip to employees to warn them about possible attempts to share sensitive data with people outside the organization. This solution does not allow you to run an investigation as required by the manager.
You should not recommend using Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Graph is a tool that enables users to create solutions that are authenticated once and use a single API call to act on security insights from security solutions. It does not allow you to run an investigation as required by the manager.

---

## Q008:

Solution: Extend Microsoft Sentinel accross workspaces

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. While extending Microsoft Sentinel across workspaces enables a unified incident view across multiple workspaces, and facilitating centralized management and monitoring of incidents, it operates seamlessly within a single Microsoft Entra tenant.

---

### References

[Extend Microsoft Sentinel across workspaces and tenants](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/extend-sentinel-across-workspaces-tenants)

## Q007:

Solution: Use workspace manager

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Workspace Manager is a feature within the Microsoft Sentinel service that enables organizations to manage multiple workspaces for different environments or business units within a single Microsoft Entra tenant.

---

### References

[Centrally manage multiple Microsoft Sentinel workspaces with workspace manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/workspace-manager)

## Q001-Q005:

> Overview

You are a Security & Compliance Analyst for CompanyA, which has an existing Microsoft 365 tenant. CompanyA has recently migrated its services to Microsoft 365 and is using the following services:

- Microsoft Entra ID to manage identity
- OneDrive for Business to facilitate users' home folders
- Exchange Online for email services
- SharePoint Online for document management
- Microsoft Teams to facilitate collaboration between internal teams and external partners

Now that the services are active, your organization has asked you to look at deploying Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to help to protect and remediate security issues on end-user devices. As the Security & Compliance Analyst, you are responsible for managing the security and compliance posture of the tenant.

> Existing Environments

The following table shows details of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint permissions for users:

|   Username  | Permissions |
|------------ | ----------- |
| AdminA@companyA.com  | Full access |
| AdminB@companyA.com  | Read-only Access |

| Laptop      | Windows 10       | 1511       | 150 |
| Laptop      | Windows 10       | 1607       | 850 |
| Desktop     | Windows 10       | 1511       | 200 |

- Old third party antivirus has been removed from Desktop devices and substituted with Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus has recently been deployed to all Laptop Windows 10 OS devices.
- Cloud-based protection is enabled.
- The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint blocking file features are configured.

The following table shows the device browser details:


| Operating System  | No. of Devices  | Installed Browser Details|
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Windows 10        | 150  | Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox     |
| Windows 10        | 850  | Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox      |
| Windows 10        | 200  | Mozilla Firefox                     |

- All users have the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 license.
- All installed browsers are configured with Internet browsing proxy settings.
- All users can access to the internet using respective browser installed on their systems.

> Requirements:

- AdminC is new to the team and requires the relevant permissions to be assigned.
- You need to ban potentially malicious files or suspected malware.
- You need to onboard all end-user devices into the Defender for Endpoint portal.
- You need to implement real-time endpoint detection and built-in remediation via Intune to add an additional layer of protection to devices.
- You need to configure device isolation to help to prevent attackers from being able to control devices.

---

## Q005:

AdminD configures device isolation on the end-user devices. However, during testing you find that it is not working on any of the devices.
What is the cause for the device isolation failing to work?

- The Windows 10 devices need to be upgraded to Windows 11.
- You need a Microsoft 365 E5 license.
- The Windows 10 devices need to be version 1703 or later.
- AdminD needs elevated permissions to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal.

---

### Answer:
- The Windows 10 devices need to be version 1703 or later.

Windows 10 devices need to be version 1703 or later. Full isolation of devices is available for devices running Windows 11, Windows 10, version 1703 or later, Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2016.
The fact that AdminD requires elevated permissions to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal is not the cause of the issue. As shown in the permissions table, AdminD has full access, which will allow them to successfully implement device isolation.
Windows 10 devices does not need to be upgraded to Windows 11. Although this would resolve the issue, it is not a requirement, as the devices need to be Windows 10 version 1703 or later. Upgrading to Windows 11 would be an option but not a requirement.
You do not need a Microsoft 365 E5 license. As shown in the Existing Environment section, users currently have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2, which is sufficient to allow the implementation of device isolation.

## Q004:

Once the end-user devices have been correctly onboarded, you need to configure additional capabilities to meet the business requirements.
Which capability should you configure to add the requirement for an additional layer of protection to devices?

- Next-Generation Protection (NGP)
- Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management
- Microsoft Defender Experts capability
- Attack Surface Reduction

---

### Answer:
- Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management

You should configure Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management to meet the requirements for real-time endpoint detection and built-in remediation via Intune. This is a component of Defender for Endpoint that provides admins and operators with many features including built-in remediation.
You should not configure Next-Generation Protection (NGP) to meet the requirements for real-time endpoint detection and built-in remediation via Intune. NGP is a feature of Microsoft Defender Antivirus that enables next generation protection of end-user devices. As the requirement is for real-time endpoint detection and built-in remediation via Intune, NGP does not allow to facilitate these specific requirements.
You should not configure Attack Surface Reduction to meet the requirements for real-time endpoint detection and built-in remediation via Intune. Attack Surface Reduction enables attack surface reduction capabilities in Defender for Endpoint to help protect devices and application from new emerging threats. As the requirement is for real-time endpoint detection and built-in remediation via Intune, Attack Surface
Reduction does not allow to facilitate these specific requirements.
You should not configure Microsoft Defender Experts capability to meet the requirement for real-time endpoint detection and built-in remediation via Intune. This is a managed hunting service that enables SOC team's expert level monitoring and analysis to assist them with critical threats.

## Q003:

AdminD is working on onboarding all end-user devices in the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal. However, they find that 200 of the devices are not being displayed in the portal. You need to investigate the issue.

Which two actions should you perform to successfully onboard end-user devices in the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

- Ensure the devices have an internet connection.
- Verify the Microsoft Windows HTTP (WinHTTP) settings.
- Ensure that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is not disabled by a policy.
- Ensure Google Chrome is installed.
- Ensure Internet Explorer is installed.

---

### Answer:
- Verify the Microsoft Windows HTTP (WinHTTP) settings.
- Ensure that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is not disabled by a policy.

You should Verify the Microsoft Windows HTTP (WinHTTP) settings. WinHTTP provides a standardized interface to send HTTP and HTTPS requests and receive responses from web servers. In order to report sensor data and communicate with the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service, the use of Microsoft Windows HTTP (WinHTTP) is required by the sensor of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Because WinHTTP operates independently from the proxy settings used for internet browsing and other applications that are context-dependent, it is necessary for WinHTTP to identify the available proxy servers within the specific environment it is being used in.
You should also ensure that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is not disabled by a policy. To function correctly, the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent requires the Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) driver to be activated. It is important to confirm that a system policy has not disabled it. Depending on the policy implementation tool being used, it is necessary to check that the Windows Defender policies listed below are not enabled:

- DisableAntiSpyware
- Disable AntiVirus

Because old third party antivirus has been removed from Desktop devices and substituted with Microsoft Defender Antivirus, it is possible, that the above mentioned policies are still activated as a previous requirement for removed third party antivirus software. As such, the policy have to be verified and disabled.
You should not ensure that devices have internet connection. According to the Existing environment section, all users can access the internet using respective browser installed on their systems.
You should not ensure that any specific browser is installed. Onboarding into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint does not specify any specific browser requirements. Specific browser only required to access Microsoft Defender for Endpoint administration portal, but not for onboarding.

## Q002:

You need to use PowerShell to assign AdminC the relevant permissions to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal.
Which cmdlets should you use? To answer, complete the commands by selecting the correct options from the drop-down menus.

OPT1:

Add-MsolRoleMember
Get-MsolRoleMember
Add-MsolGroupMember
New-MsolUser

OPT2:

"Security Reader"
"Compliance Reader"
"Security Operator"
"Security Administrator"

OPT3:

-RoleMemberEmailAddress
-RoleMemberType
-RoleMemberObjectId
-TenantId

```
[OPT1] -RoleName [opt2] [OPT3] "AdminC@companyA.com"
```

---

### Answer:

```
Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleName "Security Reader" `
-RoleMemberEmailAddress  "AdminC@companyA.com" 
```

You should complete the PowerShell cmdlet as follows:

```
Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleName "Security Reader" -RoleMemberEmailAddress "AdminC@companyA.com"
```

You need to use the Add-MsolRoleMember cmdlet. This allows you to add a user with an administrator role. In this case, you need to grant AdminC read only permissions. Therefore, you should use the 'Security Reader' RoleName parameter. Finally, you need to use the - RoleMemberEmailAddress parameter to specify AdminC's email address so that the permissions are granted to them.
You should not use the Add-MsolGroupMember cmdlet, as this adds users to an existing security group. The Get-Msol RoleMember group should not be used as this only gives you information on a specific role, rather than allowing you to assign permissions. The New-MsolUser should not be used as this allows you to create a new user in Azure AD, rather than adding elevated permissions to a user.
You should not use the 'Security Administrator' parameter, as this would grant AdminC full access to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal. The 'Security Operator' role would also give AdminC more elevated permissions than read only. The 'Compliance Admin' role would give AdminC access to the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal, not the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal.
You should not use the -Tenantld, RoleMember Objectld or the RoleMemberType parameter, as these parameters would not assign the relevant permissions to the user via the email address that has been used in the cmdlet.

## Q001:

AdminA tries to implement indicators for files in order to ban potential malicious files or suspected malware However, you find that it does not work on the existing user devices.

Which action should you take to implement indicators for files? 
You need to minimize administrative effort.

- Upgrade Windows 10 to Windows 11.
- Upgrade Windows 10 to version 1703 or later.
- Give AdminA more elevated permissions.
- Upgrade Microsoft Defender Antivirus to client version 4.18.1901.x or later.

---

### Answer:
- Upgrade Windows 10 to version 1703 or later.

You should upgrade Windows 10 OS to version 1703 or later. A prerequisite of implementing indicators for files is that end-user devices are required to be Windows 10, version 1703 or later. The Windows Server supported OS are Server 2016 and 2019.
You should not upgrade Windows 10 to Windows 11. Although this would resolve the issue, upgrading Windows 10 to Windows 11 would create additional administrative effort compared to upgrading the Windows 10 OS version, which is a simple Windows update.
You should not upgrade Microsoft Defender Antivirus to client version 4.18.1901.x or later. As highlighted in the existing environment section, Microsoft Defender Antivirus has recently been installed. The latest
versions are more recent than version 4.18.1901.x.
You should not elevate AdminA's permissions. AdminA currently has full access to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal, which grants them the relevant permissions to implement indicators for files.
