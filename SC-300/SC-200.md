## Q006-Q008:

Your organization is a Managed Service Provider (MSP) tasked with managing Microsoft Sentinel workspaces for multiple customers. Many customers require the management of multiple workspaces for different environments or business units.
You need to manage Microsoft Sentinel workspaces across multiple Microsoft Entra tenants. The precise control over the delegated scopes and allowed permissions for each customer must be maintained.

---

## Q008:

Solution: Extend Microsoft Sentinel accross workspaces

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. While extending Microsoft Sentinel across workspaces enables a unified incident view across multiple workspaces, and facilitating centralized management and monitoring of incidents, it operates seamlessly within a single Microsoft Entra tenant.

## Q007:

Solution: Use workspace manager

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
No

This solution does not meet the goal. Workspace Manager is a feature within the Microsoft Sentinel service that enables organizations to manage multiple workspaces for different environments or business units within a single Microsoft Entra tenant.

## Q006:

Solution: Use Azure Lighthouse

Does this solution meet the goal?

---

### Answer:
Yes

This solution meets the goal. Azure Lighthouse is a suitable solution for managing Microsoft Sentinel workspaces across multiple Microsoft Entra tenants. Azure Lighthouse allows Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to manage customers' Azure resources from their own Microsoft Entra tenant, including Microsof Sentinel workspaces. With Azure Lighthouse, precise control over the delegated scopes and allowed permissions for each customer is maintained.

## Q001-Q005:

> Overview

You are a Security & Compliance Analyst for CompanyA, which has an existing Microsoft 365 tenant. CompanyA has recently migrated its services to Microsoft 365 and is using the following services:

- Microsoft Entra ID to manage identity
- OneDrive for Business to facilitate users' home folders
- Exchange Online for email services
- SharePoint Online for document management
- Microsoft Teams to facilitate collaboration between internal teams and external partners

Now that the services are active, your organization has asked you to look at deploying Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to help to protect and remediate security issues on end-user devices. As the Security & Compliance Analyst, you are responsible for managing the security and compliance posture of the tenant.

> Existing Environments

The following table shows details of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint permissions for users:

|   Username  | Permissions |
|------------ | ----------- |
| AdminA@companyA.com  | Full access |
| AdminB@companyA.com  | Read-only Access |
| AdminC@companyA.com  | Read-only access |
| AdminD@CompanyA.com  | Full access |


The following table shows the end-user device details:

| Device Type | Operating System | OS Version | No. of devices |
|-------------|------------------|------------|----------------|
| Laptop      | Windows 10       | 1511       | 150 |
| Laptop      | Windows 10       | 1607       | 850 |
| Desktop     | Windows 10       | 1511       | 200 |

- Old third party antivirus has been removed from Desktop devices and substituted with Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus has recently been deployed to all Laptop Windows 10 OS devices.
- Cloud-based protection is enabled.
- The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint blocking file features are configured.

The following table shows the device browser details:


| Operating System  | No. of Devices  | Installed Browser Details|
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Windows 10        | 150  | Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox     |
| Windows 10        | 850  | Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox      |
| Windows 10        | 200  | Mozilla Firefox                     |

- All users have the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 license.
- All installed browsers are configured with Internet browsing proxy settings.
- All users can access to the internet using respective browser installed on their systems.

> Requirements:

- AdminC is new to the team and requires the relevant permissions to be assigned.
- You need to ban potentially malicious files or suspected malware.
- You need to onboard all end-user devices into the Defender for Endpoint portal.
- You need to implement real-time endpoint detection and built-in remediation via Intune to add an additional layer of protection to devices.
- You need to configure device isolation to help to prevent attackers from being able to control devices.

---

## Q005:

AdminD configures device isolation on the end-user devices. However, during testing you find that it is not working on any of the devices.
What is the cause for the device isolation failing to work?

- The Windows 10 devices need to be upgraded to Windows 11.
- You need a Microsoft 365 E5 license.
- The Windows 10 devices need to be version 1703 or later.
- AdminD needs elevated permissions to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal.

---

### Answer:
- The Windows 10 devices need to be version 1703 or later.

Windows 10 devices need to be version 1703 or later. Full isolation of devices is available for devices running Windows 11, Windows 10, version 1703 or later, Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2016.
The fact that AdminD requires elevated permissions to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal is not the cause of the issue. As shown in the permissions table, AdminD has full access, which will allow them to successfully implement device isolation.
Windows 10 devices does not need to be upgraded to Windows 11. Although this would resolve the issue, it is not a requirement, as the devices need to be Windows 10 version 1703 or later. Upgrading to Windows 11 would be an option but not a requirement.
You do not need a Microsoft 365 E5 license. As shown in the Existing Environment section, users currently have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2, which is sufficient to allow the implementation of device isolation.

## Q004:

Once the end-user devices have been correctly onboarded, you need to configure additional capabilities to meet the business requirements.
Which capability should you configure to add the requirement for an additional layer of protection to devices?

- Next-Generation Protection (NGP)
- Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management
- Microsoft Defender Experts capability
- Attack Surface Reduction

---

### Answer:
- Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management

You should configure Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management to meet the requirements for real-time endpoint detection and built-in remediation via Intune. This is a component of Defender for Endpoint that provides admins and operators with many features including built-in remediation.
You should not configure Next-Generation Protection (NGP) to meet the requirements for real-time endpoint detection and built-in remediation via Intune. NGP is a feature of Microsoft Defender Antivirus that enables next generation protection of end-user devices. As the requirement is for real-time endpoint detection and built-in remediation via Intune, NGP does not allow to facilitate these specific requirements.
You should not configure Attack Surface Reduction to meet the requirements for real-time endpoint detection and built-in remediation via Intune. Attack Surface Reduction enables attack surface reduction capabilities in Defender for Endpoint to help protect devices and application from new emerging threats. As the requirement is for real-time endpoint detection and built-in remediation via Intune, Attack Surface
Reduction does not allow to facilitate these specific requirements.
You should not configure Microsoft Defender Experts capability to meet the requirement for real-time endpoint detection and built-in remediation via Intune. This is a managed hunting service that enables SOC team's expert level monitoring and analysis to assist them with critical threats.

## Q003:

AdminD is working on onboarding all end-user devices in the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal. However, they find that 200 of the devices are not being displayed in the portal. You need to investigate the issue.

Which two actions should you perform to successfully onboard end-user devices in the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

- Ensure the devices have an internet connection.
- Verify the Microsoft Windows HTTP (WinHTTP) settings.
- Ensure that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is not disabled by a policy.
- Ensure Google Chrome is installed.
- Ensure Internet Explorer is installed.

---

### Answer:
- Verify the Microsoft Windows HTTP (WinHTTP) settings.
- Ensure that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is not disabled by a policy.

You should Verify the Microsoft Windows HTTP (WinHTTP) settings. WinHTTP provides a standardized interface to send HTTP and HTTPS requests and receive responses from web servers. In order to report sensor data and communicate with the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service, the use of Microsoft Windows HTTP (WinHTTP) is required by the sensor of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Because WinHTTP operates independently from the proxy settings used for internet browsing and other applications that are context-dependent, it is necessary for WinHTTP to identify the available proxy servers within the specific environment it is being used in.
You should also ensure that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is not disabled by a policy. To function correctly, the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent requires the Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) driver to be activated. It is important to confirm that a system policy has not disabled it. Depending on the policy implementation tool being used, it is necessary to check that the Windows Defender policies listed below are not enabled:

- DisableAntiSpyware
- Disable AntiVirus

Because old third party antivirus has been removed from Desktop devices and substituted with Microsoft Defender Antivirus, it is possible, that the above mentioned policies are still activated as a previous requirement for removed third party antivirus software. As such, the policy have to be verified and disabled.
You should not ensure that devices have internet connection. According to the Existing environment section, all users can access the internet using respective browser installed on their systems.
You should not ensure that any specific browser is installed. Onboarding into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint does not specify any specific browser requirements. Specific browser only required to access Microsoft Defender for Endpoint administration portal, but not for onboarding.

## Q002:

You need to use PowerShell to assign AdminC the relevant permissions to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal.
Which cmdlets should you use? To answer, complete the commands by selecting the correct options from the drop-down menus.

OPT1:

Add-MsolRoleMember
Get-MsolRoleMember
Add-MsolGroupMember
New-MsolUser

OPT2:

"Security Reader"
"Compliance Reader"
"Security Operator"
"Security Administrator"

OPT3:

-RoleMemberEmailAddress
-RoleMemberType
-RoleMemberObjectId
-TenantId

```
[OPT1] -RoleName [opt2] [OPT3] "AdminC@companyA.com"
```

---

### Answer:

```
Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleName "Security Reader" `
-RoleMemberEmailAddress  "AdminC@companyA.com" 
```

You should complete the PowerShell cmdlet as follows:

```
Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleName "Security Reader" -RoleMemberEmailAddress "AdminC@companyA.com"
```

You need to use the Add-MsolRoleMember cmdlet. This allows you to add a user with an administrator role. In this case, you need to grant AdminC read only permissions. Therefore, you should use the 'Security Reader' RoleName parameter. Finally, you need to use the - RoleMemberEmailAddress parameter to specify AdminC's email address so that the permissions are granted to them.
You should not use the Add-MsolGroupMember cmdlet, as this adds users to an existing security group. The Get-Msol RoleMember group should not be used as this only gives you information on a specific role, rather than allowing you to assign permissions. The New-MsolUser should not be used as this allows you to create a new user in Azure AD, rather than adding elevated permissions to a user.
You should not use the 'Security Administrator' parameter, as this would grant AdminC full access to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal. The 'Security Operator' role would also give AdminC more elevated permissions than read only. The 'Compliance Admin' role would give AdminC access to the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal, not the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal.
You should not use the -Tenantld, RoleMember Objectld or the RoleMemberType parameter, as these parameters would not assign the relevant permissions to the user via the email address that has been used in the cmdlet.

## Q001:

AdminA tries to implement indicators for files in order to ban potential malicious files or suspected malware However, you find that it does not work on the existing user devices.

Which action should you take to implement indicators for files? 
You need to minimize administrative effort.

- Upgrade Windows 10 to Windows 11.
- Upgrade Windows 10 to version 1703 or later.
- Give AdminA more elevated permissions.
- Upgrade Microsoft Defender Antivirus to client version 4.18.1901.x or later.

---

### Answer:
- Upgrade Windows 10 to version 1703 or later.

You should upgrade Windows 10 OS to version 1703 or later. A prerequisite of implementing indicators for files is that end-user devices are required to be Windows 10, version 1703 or later. The Windows Server supported OS are Server 2016 and 2019.
You should not upgrade Windows 10 to Windows 11. Although this would resolve the issue, upgrading Windows 10 to Windows 11 would create additional administrative effort compared to upgrading the Windows 10 OS version, which is a simple Windows update.
You should not upgrade Microsoft Defender Antivirus to client version 4.18.1901.x or later. As highlighted in the existing environment section, Microsoft Defender Antivirus has recently been installed. The latest
versions are more recent than version 4.18.1901.x.
You should not elevate AdminA's permissions. AdminA currently has full access to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal, which grants them the relevant permissions to implement indicators for files.
